#+title: Data Struct

* Elementary Data Structures

** Arrays
- Arrays are the most fundamental linear data structure sometimes called a list or vector.
 #+begin_src java

int[] array = {2,3,4,5,6}

 #+end_src
- They store objects of identical size consecutively in memory
- On a Random Access Machine they can be accessed via the array index in constant time

*** Pointer

- The array index can be a variable in itself, enabling pointer operations such as

 #+begin_src python :file sample.py
    a = [7,9,2,2,3] # Python only used as it is the simplest code to express this problem
    i = 2
    x=a[i]
    print(x)
 #+end_src

 #+RESULTS:
 : None

- Since array indexes are also integers, the random access machines can also perform pointer arithmetic

 #+begin_example
        A[2*i-1]
 #+end_example
