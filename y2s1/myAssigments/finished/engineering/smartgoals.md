# Smart Goals

SMART: Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant Time-bound

## Goal 1: Improve Professor-Student Disability accommodation

- Specific: Covers the particular issue in that many lecturers ignore students DSS needs.
- Measurable: The current unknown statistic could be improved by a percentile (40%)
- Attainable: If lecturers are required to use this system then lecturers will be frequently reminded to 
              ensure all students DSS needs are met.
- Relevant: This goal is extremely relevant as many students have given their lecturers various 
            simple needs such as being given notes prior to lectures or separate rooms for exams
            and have been ignored
- Time Bound: While not directly time bound, this goal will be time bound throughout each
                semester and exam season.

## Goal 2: Streamline the IEC process for Students

- Specific: This goal is specific in that it covers how now students will be able to view  previous
            IECs, check their outstanding IEC statuses and they will be given a rough estimate on when their IEC will be accepted.

- Measurable: This goal can be measured in both the amount of IECs that are accepted and can be surveyed through
                student surveys.

- Attainable: The main portage for this would be moving the IEC forms to this ENMS and rerouting the original
                site to this system. All aspects of the goal are easily attainable once lecturers are notified 
                frequently.

- Relevant: This goal is quite relevant as most students will at some point come across a time where they will 
            need to fill out an IEC whether due to a passing family members, sicknesses etc

- Time Bound: This goal in particular can be easily time bound from when an IEC is filled to the estimated time all the way to 
              once the IEC is accepted or rejected

## Goal 3: Ensure lecturers keep up with current DSS and IEC exam affairs:

- Specific: This goal is specific in that it covers how lecturers will be notified via email and/or sms
            on ensuring students DSS needs or IECs are met and exams go as smoothly as possible for 
            any students dealing with issues.

- Measurable: Lecturers can be both surveyed and monitored on how up to date they are with needs
                and individual extenuating circumstances through their acceptance rate and 
                checkboxes for meeting needs

- Attainable: This goal is easily attainable as it will be embedded into all lecturers workflows
              while they are being trained in.

- Relevant: This goal is very relevant in that many lecturers miss certain exam issues and just
            move along as if no problems can crop up and we as students have all seen this occur.

- Time-Bound: Once this is implemented a time limit can be put on evaluating the measurable
              aspects of this goal.
