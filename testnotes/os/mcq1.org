* Operating systems mcq notes

- Operating system is the layer of software between the applications and the computer hardware

  - It manages the execution of applications
  - It manages the resources given to applications

    - Ensures efficient use of a processor
    - Allows switching between multiple processes (concurrency)


** Processes:

- A unit of activity characterised by the execution of a sequence of instructions

  - It consists of a PCB, set of instructions and associated data


** Control structures:

*** File table

- Contains all info about existence of files
- Current Location in disk
- Current status
  
*** Process table
- File access
- Current IO status
- Location in memory
- Uses Cross references to the other tables

*** IO table
- What IO is being used and what is available
- Status of current io operation on each device
 - Source/destination used in main memory
*** Memory table

- Allocation of main and virtual memroy to processes
  - Info for managing virtual memory
 - Protection info about segments of main memory ie whoch processes may access shared memory areas

* Process Control Block

- Process Control block are the attributes of a process stored with the process

  - The pcb is unique for each process
  - Three categories of info for the PCB

    1. Process ID
    2. CPU State info
    3. Prcess control info


*** PID
- Process identification
  - Unique numeric value for the process, its Parent process and the associated

*** CPU State info
- Execution context of the process ie copies of the current values
  of the cpu registers for this process need to be stores when the process isnt using the CPU

  - Such as: Programmer visible registers
  - Control and status registers (PC,IR,MAR,MBR, Program Status Word.)
