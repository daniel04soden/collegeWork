# Daniel Soden Retrospective 

## Make the project better

- To make this project better in my opinion I would prefer to have been given
    all of the work from the beginning and we split the work into sprints ourself


## Who did what in the project and how well 

- Daniel (Me) - I completed all of my assignments but in particular my teammates
                highlighted my contributions to the Use case diagram and my 
                wire frames.

- Gavin -   Gavin did a variety of work and was assigned similar work throughout
            the entire project however he did some really good work for our justinmind 
            prototype.

- Fawaz -   Fawaz like everyone else tipped away at some solid work we were all 
            assigned but the highlight of his work was the work on the SRS doc.

- Ben -     Ben did his assigned work and to a really high quality but in 
            particular he did some great work on the Visual paradigm grids.


## What factors can help bring more active participation of each member?

- Mainly being able to start the project work during the labs and 
  that would give us a good head start for the week.
