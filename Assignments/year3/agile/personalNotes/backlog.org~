#+title: Product Backlog - Animal Shelter ML

* TODO Sprint 1 - Organising and Parsing the data []
- [] Remove monthyear Column
  - [] Once monthyear deleted, split date and time
    -[] Time needs seconds taken out as always XX:00
- [] Overall, combine two csv files into one with unique identifiers as each row
- [] Create column for if still in/out ie outcome may be null - if not in outcome, have boolean for in shelter still
  - This will need a lot of evaluation of both files, many cells/entries may be removed as some with outcomes may not be included in intakes and vice versa
- [] Get rid of names, irrelevant to trends and chatbot info, will take up processing power
- [] Age can be removed, date of birth infers and can calculate current age as time goes on
- [] For any species labelled as other, replace other with breed entry
  - If the Other breed includes mix, we leave breed as mix and species as animal
  - Otherwise itd be like bat bat
- [] Add separate column for being spayed/neutered or not - boolean as spay/neuter is inferred by gender
- [] Remove sex upon outcome, sex will not change intime
