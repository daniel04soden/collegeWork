# OOAD

- Is a popular technical approach to analysis design and application system or businesses by applying oop as well as modelling to foster stakeholder communication.
- OOAD is best conducted in an iterative and incremental way.
- Iteration by iteration the outputs of OOAD activities and analysis models OOA and design models OOAD respectively will be refined and evolve continuously driven by key factors like risk and business value

## Characteristics of OO systems
### Classes and Objects
- Object: Instance of a class 
- Attributes: Info that describes the class
- State: describes its values and relationships at a point in time
### Methods and messages

- Methods: Behaviour of a class
- messages info sent to an object to trigger a method

### Encapsulation and Information hiding 
- Encapsulation :combination of process and data 
- information hiding is when functionality is hidden

### Inheritance
- Inheritance is general classes created to create children classes(super classes)
- Sub classes inherit data and methods from a super class

### Polymorphism and dynamic binding
- The same message can have different meanings
- Dynamic binding the type of object not determined until run time
- Contrast with static binding

- drawSelf() - circle,square, triangle

### Abstraction

- Something which is non concrete
- Abstraction in programming means to create an interface or an abstract class which is non-concrete. This means we cant create an object of an interface or an abstract class.

- Eg person, doctor, surgeon.
## Use case driven OOAD

- Use cases define the behaviour of a system and each focuses on one business process

##  Architecture driven OOAD

- Functional view focuses on users perspective
- Static view focuses on attributes methods classes and relationships
- Dynamic, view focuses on messages between classes and resulting behaviours


- Iterative and incremental
- Undergoes continuous testing and refinement
- The analyst understand the system better over time

# Benefits of OOSAD

- Breaks complex system into smaller manageable modules and works on modules individually.
