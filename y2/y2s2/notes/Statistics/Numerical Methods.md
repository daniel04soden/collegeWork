# Measures of centrality

## Data description


### Numerical Methods
- Given some data in a list frequency table or a grouped table how do we describe such data?
- The only way is to use frequency tables or graphical methods. (eg pie or bar charts)
- We can use numerical methods or summary statistics
- Summary statistics are numbers used to summarise statistics.

## 1. Measures of Centrality

- The value of the centre or middle of a data set is determined by a measure of centrality
- There are three measures of centrality
- Mode, Mean Median

## 2. Measures of variation
- Describe how spread out the data is from the centre of the data 
- - Three main:
1. Range
2. Standard deviation and variance
3. Interquartile range


# Mode 

- Most frequent value in a data set.
- Mode not always unique

- Data set may be:
	- Bi modal - Two frequent values
	- Multi modal - More than two frequent values
	- No mode
## Adv vs Disadv


| Adv                               | Disadv                            |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Easy to work out                  | Small samples may not have a mode |
| Not affected by extreme values    | More than one mode may exist      |
| Value exisits in data             |                                   |
| Can be used with categorical data |                                   |

# Mean

- Sum of all the values in the data set divided by the number of values ie average

- The capital sigma means adding up what comes after .
- The sample mean is where n is the sample size given ie divided by a particular quantity not the entire quantity
- Outliers consistently skew data in the mean ie if we have dataset{1,2,45,6,7} 45 will skew our data
## Sample vs Population

- Which mean is used depends on how the data was collected.
- Sometimes it is unfeasible or impossible to measure the entire population. In those cases some individuals are sampled to provide an estimate for the entire population

# Median

- Median is the middle value in an ordered list/data
- Half the values are smaller than or equal to the median and half are larger or equal to it
- Steps to calc
1. Arrange in increasing order
2. Median is the number will be around the position n+1/2
3. Where n is the number of values in the dataset
