# Independent and dependent Events
- Two or more events are said to be independent if the outcome of the first event does not affect probability of the second.

# Multiplication rule

- There are two binary aspects we need to combine when comparing events A and B 

1. Whether A and B are independent or dependent
2. Whether the order of the events matters
## Rule 1
- If events a and b are dependent and the order matters then the probability of A followed by b is given by

$$
P(A \ n \ B) = P(a)*(P(B|A))
$$
- Where p(B|A) is the conditional probability read as B given A of event B occurring given that A has occured


- Probability of picking red marble from bags after already picking a blue.
## Rule 2
- If events A and B are dependent and the order doesn't matter then we need to count each possible order

$$
P(A and B any order) = P(AnB) + P(BnA) = P(A)*P(B|A) + P(B)*(PA|B)
$$


- Probability tree is a diagram that shows all possible outcomes and their associated probabilities in a series of events for example image a tree diagram for a coin toss 
- Can be used to describe dependent and independent events

# Random Variable

- Mapping between events and numbers
- Eg toss a coin 10 times and let x be the number of heads

- Not :
	- Drawing a white marble from a bag of marbles and recording the colour

# Probability Distribution

- A frequency distribution shows us how many times given values in a range occur
- A probability distribution is similar as it shows us how likely each value of a random  variable is 
- The notation P(X=x) means the probability that the random variable X attains the value of x
