# 3 Methods of presenting data

1. Data lists
2. Frequency tables
3. Grouped Frequency tables

- Each representation can convey more less info depending on when it used

## 1. Data lists

- When a data set is mall enough a list is quick and efficient representation
- This can easily become inefficient as data sets become larger


## 2. Frequency Distribution tables

### 1. Frequency tables

- Amount of times values show up 
- Used for discrete data
- Individual data values listed

### 2. Grouped frequency tables

- Used for discrete or continuous data
- Organised in intervals
- [[Grouped Frequency tables]]

#### Example  1

- Frequency table

| Values | Frequency |
| ------ | --------- |
| 0      | 2         |
| 1      | 2         |
| 2      | 5         |
| 3      | 4         |
| 4      | 2         |
| 5      | 1         |
- 5 matches
- 7
- 16
- 37

## Cumulative Frequency

- Obtained by adding the frequencies as you go along.
- The final cumulative frequency is equal to the total number of data values.
### What are they used for:

1. Determine number of observation that lie above of a particular value in a data set
2. find specific values in a data IE median first quartile etc
3. draw ogives (Graphs for cumulative frequency)

## Relative frequency

- Normalising the frequency
- IE the frequency divided b the total frequency IE lie an average
- the values can be recorded as fractions, decimals or percentages
- Compute the frequencies for the frequency table

- When comparing two groups and the number of values in the two groups isnt the same, we use relative frequencies for comparison
