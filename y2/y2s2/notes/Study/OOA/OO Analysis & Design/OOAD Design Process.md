Chief task of OO program design is to *assign responsibilities* to the objects
A *responsibility* is an *obligation* of an object to to other objects
An object may be responsible for knowing:
- *What it knows* - Its attributes
- *Who it knows* - The objects associated with it
- *What it knows how to do* - the operations it can perform
May be responsible for:
- Doing something itself
- Requesting services from other objects
- Controlling and coordinating the activities of other objects
### OO Design Steps
1. Produce an interaction diagram for each system operation
2. Produce a design class diagram showing the operations from the interaction diagrams
3. Specify the signature and the algorithm for each operation
4. Design the graphical user interface
5. Define the interface to the presentation layer
6. Define the interface to the storage layer
7. Place the classes in packages
