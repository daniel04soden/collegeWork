# What are interfaces

- Interfaces are blueprints of a class/system that ensures that certain methods and attributes are implemented
## Hierarchies 

- Inheritance can be applied too
- One interface can be used as a parent of another
- The child inherits the abstract methods
- And class hierarchies and interface hierarchies are distinct (No overlap)
## Reasoning

- Standards
- High quality
- Getting lost
- Todo as code kekw
