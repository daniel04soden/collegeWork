- Can we allocate this file? # Constraint:
- Space within hdds array
  - Space of current and is this one full?

* Goal
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: goal
:END:
- Fill up hard drives with given files

* Solution ideas
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: solution-ideas
:END:
- Keep in mind final should kinda be like {0,0,1,2,2,2....}
- Back track may be through a -1
- Separate function for validation
- For that separation, we can do the check if its already full...
- How do we track a middle of allocation hdd - *NOT ALLOWED*
- Main thoughts are += another dupe array of size hdd
- Seems too brute forcey
- and then would our backtrack then be:
  - -= foo
  - foo = -1
- Key consistent backtrack -> if legal/valid true: all good return foo
- Otherwise don't return, go to default but before then, backtrack

1. Check if solution found - at the last file index
2. Otherwise not returning, loop over result index
3. If the allocation is -1, allocate to the fileIdx we're looking at
4. Move to next file
5. Then if it's valid, return res - May need to be changed to a
   recursive step here..
6. Otherwise move fileIdx back and set it to -1
