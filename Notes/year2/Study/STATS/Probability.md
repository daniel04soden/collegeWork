# What is probability?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Probability is the likelihood an event will happen \## Random
  Experiments

- A procedure that can be repeated infinitely and can only produce a
  fixed and known set of outcomes

- **Sample Space**: the set of possible outcomes of a random experiment

- For example. having a die and where you roll it twitce, the sample
  space is all the combinations of two that can occur: 1,1 2,5 etc

- The probability space is a triple: sample space, how outcomes are
  grouped into events and the probability function. \## Addition Rule
  ​**\*\*** \### Mutually exclusive and non-mutually exclusive events

- Mutually exclusive events cannot occur at the same time ie:

- Non-mutually exclusive events can occur at the same time therefore we
  can have some crossover in the venn diagram between A and B eg, odd
  numbers on a dice or numbers greater than 3 on a dice

- When calculating the probability of events with a on-empty
  intersection we need to be careful to not count it twice!

Mutually exclusive events addition rule

$$P(A or B) = P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B)$$

$$P(A or B) = P(AUB) = P(AUBUC) + P(A) + P(B) + P(C)$$
\#### Non-mutually exclusive events addition rule
$$P(A or B) = P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AnB)$$

Independent and dependent events - **Independent events**: Two or more
events are said to be independent if the outcome of the first does not
affect the outcome of the second - **Dependent events**: Two or more
events are said to be independent if the outcome of the first affects
the outcome of the second. \#### Independent events when order matters -
$P(AnB) = P(A)P(B)$ \#### Dependent events when order matters -
$P(AnB) = P(A)P(B|A)$ \#### Independent events when order does not
matter - $P(AnB) + P(BnA) = P(A)P(B)+P(B)P(A)$ \#### Dependent events
when order does not matter - $P(AnB) + P(BnA) = P(A)P(B|A)+P(B)P(A|B)$
​## Probability tree

### How to draw one:

1.  Draw branch for each outcome of first
2.  Wirte outcome at end
3.  Write probability of each outcome to the next corresponding branch
4.  for further events, draw new branches coming out the ends of each
    preceding outcomes
5.  The sum of each probabilities of all possible outcomes must be 1
