# Statistical Inference

- How does the CSO estimate things over the population of Ireland?

- Statistical inference is the process of estimating the characteristics
  of the underlying population distribution from the observations of a
  sample.

- Population - all individuals or units of interest

- Sample - a subset of the population

- Statistic is the feature of interest calculated from a sample used to
  estimate a parameter.

  - the sample mean provides an estimate of the overall mean
  - The sample proportion provides an estimate of the actual proportion
  - The population of the standard deviation may be estimated from the
    sample standard deviation \## Point estimate

- Point estimates use a single value to approximate the population
  parameter as a single value

## Interval estimate

- Type of estimation that uses an type of estimation that uses an
  interval of values based on sampling info to estimate the population
  parameter

- An interval parameter provides a range of values within which the true
  population parameter is likely to fall

## Sampling distribution

- The value of the sample statistic can be modelled as a random variable
  ie numerical quantity whose value is dependent on the random outcome
  of an experiment.

- The central limit theorem is one of the strongest results form
  probability theory

- It sttaes that the mean of sufficient many random variables which are
  independent and identially distributes converges to a normal
  distrubiton with the same mean and a similar standard deviation

### Central limit theorem

- With notation let X be the ith independent sample form a population if
  n is the sample size then
- for a mean Sn = X1+X2..+Xn divded by n so that SnSQRT(n) is normally
  distributed, with a mean u and standard deviation sigma as n -\>
  infinity (grows arbitrarily)
