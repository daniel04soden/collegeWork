:END:
- Statistics provides scientific methods to quantify evidence/empirical
  information #### Features
- Science of observation
- Structured with modern science
- Changes with scientific paradigms

**** Importance
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: importance
:END:
***** Use cases
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: use-cases
:END:
- Data Science
- Data Analysis
- Machine learning
- Project management/quality assurance
- Decision-making
- Large-scale crisis ### Maths

**** Features
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: features
:END:
- Science of patterns

** Reasoning
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: reasoning
:END:
- Now that we know why it is important, we must now learn the basics ##
  Data types

- What may not be represented as data? ### Two main types of data:

1. Categorical
2. Numerical

**** Categorical
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: categorical
:END:
***** Examples
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: examples
:END:
- Gender
- Race
- Petal Colour
- Location name

***** Categorical Sub types
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: categorical-sub-types
:END:
****** Ordinal
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ordinal
:END:
- When it makes more sense to organise in a particular order. Ratings,
  education level etc
- Spice level ###### Nominal
- No clear order among items.
- Eye color, food preference

**** Numerical
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: numerical
:END:
- Height
- Population
- Petal Length
- Co-ordinates ##### Categorical Sub types ###### Discrete
- Can be counted (poker hands, passengers in airport, cousins) ######
  Continuous
- Decimal points and need to be measured (eg Physical quantities, GDP
  per capita)

****** Interval
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: interval
:END:
- Has an equidistant scale where the zero point is an arbitrary number
  (Celsius 37 humans, pH 7) ###### Ratio

- A zero implies in a qualitative change to interpretation, often
  meaning absence of something. (Mass,number of people in a house)
