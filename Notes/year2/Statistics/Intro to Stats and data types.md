## Difference between Statistics and Mathematics

### Statistics

1.  Definition

    - Statistics provides scientific methods to quantify
      evidence/empirical information \#### Features
    - Science of observation
    - Structured with modern science
    - Changes with scientific paradigms

2.  Importance

    1.  Use cases

        - Data Science
        - Data Analysis
        - Machine learning
        - Project management/quality assurance
        - Decision-making
        - Large-scale crisis \### Maths

3.  Features

    - Science of patterns
    - Looking at order
    - Spontaneously developed in different civilisations
    - Invented or discovered...

# Data types

## Reasoning

- Now that we know why it is important, we must now learn the basics \##
  Data types

- What may not be represented as data? \### Two main types of data:

1.  Categorical
2.  Numerical

Categorical

1.  Examples

    - Gender
    - Race
    - Petal Colour
    - Location name

2.  Categorical Sub types

    1.  Ordinal

        - When it makes more sense to organise in a particular order.
          Ratings, education level etc
        - Spice level \###### Nominal
        - No clear order among items.
        - Eye color, food preference

Numerical

- Height
- Population
- Petal Length
- Co-ordinates \##### Categorical Sub types \###### Discrete
- Can be counted (poker hands, passengers in airport, cousins) \######
  Continuous
- Decimal points and need to be measured (eg Physical quantities, GDP
  per capita)

1.  Interval

    - Has an equidistant scale where the zero point is an arbitrary
      number (Celsius 37 humans, pH 7) \###### Ratio

    - A zero implies in a qualitative change to interpretation, often
      meaning absence of something. (Mass,number of people in a house)
