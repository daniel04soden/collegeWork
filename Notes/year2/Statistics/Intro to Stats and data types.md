#### Features
- Science of observation
- Structured with modern science
- Changes with scientific paradigms

#### Importance 
##### Use cases
- Data Science
- Data Analysis
- Machine learning
- Project management/quality assurance
- Decision-making 
- Large-scale crisis
### Maths

#### Features 
- Science of patterns
- Looking at order
- Spontaneously developed in different civilisations

# Data types

## Reasoning

- Now that we know why it is important, we must now learn the basics
## Data types

- What may not be represented as data?
### Two main types of data:

1. Categorical
2. Numerical

#### Categorical
##### Examples
- Gender
- Race
- Petal Colour
- Location name

##### Categorical Sub types
###### Ordinal
- When it makes more sense to organise in a particular order. Ratings, education level etc
- Spice level
###### Nominal
- No clear order among items.
- Eye color, food preference

#### Numerical

- Height
- Population
- Petal Length
- Co-ordinates
##### Categorical Sub types
###### Discrete
- Can be counted (poker hands, passengers in airport, cousins)
###### Continuous
- Decimal points and need to be measured (eg Physical quantities, GDP per capita)

###### Interval
- Has an equidistant scale where the zero point is an arbitrary number (Celsius  37 humans, pH 7)
###### Ratio

- A zero implies in a qualitative change to interpretation, often meaning absence of something.  (Mass,number of people in a house)
