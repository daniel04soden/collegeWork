- In this topic we will look into how events can be combined via what is
  called the addition principle, an idea borrowed from combinatorics

- If we say A is the event obtaining an even number after rolling a die,
  then P(A) = 1/2

- Now say b is the chance of obtaining less than 3 in the die roll what
  is probability of A or B

- Event A would be in a simple set circle with only the set of 2,6,4

- Event A or b would be a venn diagram of sorts containing an
  intersection at 2

- When calculating the probability of events with a no empty
  intersection we need to be careful to not count it twice

- P(A or B) = P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AnB)

# Set operations

- Reminder: A union B, A intersection B and Without b etc

# Mutually exclusive event

- Two events A and B are mutually exclusive if their intersection is
  empty. That is they cannot occur at the same time.

# Non-Mutually exclusive event

- Two events A and B are mutually exclusive if their intersection is non
  empty. That is they can occur at the same time.

- They share at least one outcome

- Drawing a number randomly from a sequence from -2 to 2, Non negative
  and even numbers.

## Addition Principle

- Basic counting principle

- for three mutually exclusive events the previous formula simpliefies
  to

P(AUBUC) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)
