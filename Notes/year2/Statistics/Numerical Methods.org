*** Numerical Methods
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: numerical-methods
:END:
- Given some data in a list frequency table or a grouped table how do we
  describe such data?
- The only way is to use frequency tables or graphical methods. (eg pie
  or bar charts)
- We can use numerical methods or summary statistics
- Summary statistics are numbers used to summarise statistics.

** 1. Measures of Centrality
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: measures-of-centrality-1
:END:
- The value of the centre or middle of a data set is determined by a
  measure of centrality
- There are three measures of centrality
- Mode, Mean Median

** 2. Measures of variation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: measures-of-variation
:END:
- Describe how spread out the data is from the centre of the data
- 
  - Three main:

1. Range
2. Standard deviation and variance
3. Interquartile range

* Mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: mode
:END:
- Most frequent value in a data set.

- Mode not always unique

- Data set may be:

  - Bi modal - Two frequent values
  - Multi modal - More than two frequent values
  - No mode ## Adv vs Disadv

| Adv                               | Disadv                            |
|-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------|
| Easy to work out                  | Small samples may not have a mode |
| Not affected by extreme values    | More than one mode may exist      |
| Value exisits in data             |                                   |
| Can be used with categorical data |                                   |

* Mean
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: mean
:END:
- Sum of all the values in the data set divided by the number of values
  ie average

- The capital sigma means adding up what comes after .

- The sample mean is where n is the sample size given ie divided by a
  particular quantity not the entire quantity

- Outliers consistently skew data in the mean ie if we have
  dataset{1,2,45,6,7} 45 will skew our data ## Sample vs Population

- Which mean is used depends on how the data was collected.

- Sometimes it is unfeasible or impossible to measure the entire
  population. In those cases some individuals are sampled to provide an
  estimate for the entire population

* Median
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: median
:END:
- Median is the middle value in an ordered list/data
- Half the values are smaller than or equal to the median and half are
  larger or equal to it
- Steps to calc

1. Arrange in increasing order
2. Median is the number will be around the position n+1/2
3. Where n is the number of values in the dataset
