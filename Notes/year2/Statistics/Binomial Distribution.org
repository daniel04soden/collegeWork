- The kth position of the nth level tells us how many ways are there to
  combine k elements with within n

- We denote the combination of k items among n as (formula in notes)
  where n! and n k is pronounced n choose k.

- For fixed n and p the probability of a binomial random variable being
  equal to is given by (formula in notes)

- P is the probability of success

- 1-p is the probability of failure

- K number of successes

- N is the number of trials

- The binomial distribution is a sum of independent Bernoulli trials so
  it also discrete
