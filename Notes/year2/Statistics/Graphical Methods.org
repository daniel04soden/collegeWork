** Data Description
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: data-description
:END:
- If we registered data from a team playing a championship there re many
  different way to describe such data.

- Graphical methods is the representation of data in a graphical format

- The type of graphical method we use depends on the data type

*** Categorical data
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: categorical-data
:END:
- It does not map top numeric scale and must divided into categories
- the number of units falling into each category can be counted
- A bar or pie chart can be used to represent categorical data.
- For example, consider a sample of 1,056 students and the type of
  material they download from the internet

**** Bar chat
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: bar-chat
:END:
- A bar chart can be used to present this data where each category is
  represented by a bar and the height represents the frequency for each
  category
- It is a simple and effective way of representing categorical data and
  discrete numerical data
- The horizontal axis represent the values in the data set
- the vertical axis represents the frequency of each value

**** Histograms
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: histograms
:END:
- Bar chat consisting of series of vertically drawn bars

- Used for continuous data

- Classes interval - x axis

- Vertical axis

  - Same class widths
  - Different class widths: frequencies per unit of the different
    classes or frequency density

- The shape of a histogram provides the important info about the
  distributions of the data

- Two shapes of interest

- Asymmetric = skewed

- Symmetric - bell shaped

- These properties are important in determining what kind of method of
  analysis is needed for the statistical inference ##### Constructing a
  histogram

- GIven a grouped frequency table with different class widths to
  construct a histogram you must calculate the frequency per unit for
  each interval

1. Calculate the width of each class (upper bound - lower bound),\\
2. Select the unit size (the smallest width of the classes),\\
3. Calculate the number of units in each class ... (width รท size)\\
4. Calculate the frequency density for each class ... (frequency รท
   number of units)

**** Pie chart
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pie-chart
:END:
- A pie chart represents each category as a proportion or percentage of
  the total frequency
- A pie chart is visual representation of relative frequency
- Sector angle = Relative frequency ( as a decimal ) x 360

*** Numerical Data
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: numerical-data
:END:
- Have numerical values

1. Stem and leaf plot
2. Histogram
3. Box-plot

**** Stem and Leaf Plot
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: stem-and-leaf-plot
:END:
- This is used to visualise numerical data
- It is a useful way to represent smaller sets of data because:

1. All original values are shown
2. Illustrates the data distribution and where the data is concentrated

- It contains two column separated by a vertical line
- The left column has the stem and the right has the leaves
- When constructing it, we must:

1. Include a key to show how the stem and leaf combine
2. List the stems and leaves in ascending order

* Skewed data
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: skewed-data
:END:
- Left right or now normalised skew distribution essentially.

- Like leaving cert stuff.

- Left skew has top data on right and vice versa

- A left skewed or negatively skewed distribution is where most of the
  data is to the right of the histogram

- A right skewed distribution is where most of the data is to the left
  of the histogram

- We need to locate the peak and see how the data is dispersed to each
  of its sides.

* Five number summary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: five-number-summary
:END:
- The five number summary of a dataset consists of the following values
  presented in ascending order:

1. Min
2. Q1: Value under which 25% of data points are found in an ordered
   dataset
3. Q2:(Median) Value under which 50% of data points are found in an
   ordered dataset
4. Q3: Value under which 75% of data points are found in an ordered
   dataset
5. Maximum

** Box Plot
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: box-plot
:END:
- A presentation of the data based on the five number summary

1. Range - Max - min
2. Median - Vertical line inside the box
3. First quartile - Vertical line at the left side of the box
4. Third quartile - Vertical line at the right side of the box
5. Box contains the middle 50% of the values - IE interquartile range

- The shape of a boxplot provides info about the distribution of data
  and allows us to identify certain statistical values

- They divide the data into section that each contain 25% of the data.

- You can quickly detect any skewness int he shape of a distribution

- An outlier is a dta point that differes significantly from other
  observations

- Box plots are used to detect outliers that exist in a data

- How come?

  - Wouldn't the outlier be between the max and min.

*** Min and max
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: min-and-max
:END:
- The min and max in a box plot are not always the min and max found in
  the dataset values
- They can be functions of the interquartile range which is the length
  going from the first to the third quartile
- If the min data value is higher the Q1 - 1.5 * IQ, the whisker stops
  in the min data value. The max is analogous ie it is the max dta value
  if that value is lower than Q3+1.5 *IQR

*** Boxplot construction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: boxplot-construction
:END:
1. Calculate five number summary for your data
2. Draw horizoinatal line for scale of measurement of the data
3. Draw a box above the line with the left and rihgt ends at Q1 and Q3
4. Draw a line through the box at the location of the median
5. Find the length of each whisker by evaluating the min and max
6. Finish the boxplot by drawing the outliers with
   circles![[Screenshot_20250128_145428.png]]![[Screenshot_20250128_145450.png]]

* Measures of variation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: measures-of-variation
:END:
** Why would you need to know anything more than a mean
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: why-would-you-need-to-know-anything-more-than-a-mean
:END:
- In many cases data may disperse so much from the mean that the measure
  may fail to describe well many of the data point

- Using only a measure of centrality we cant determine how data is
  spread, how close the data set is to the mean and what if the two sets
  of data have the same mean are, the data sets equal then??

- If we consider only the mean we cant recognise any idfference between
  two samples as they both have a mean of 2 inches

- However it should be obvious that the samples are very different in
  the amounts that the bolts vary in length.

- The main measures of variation are range, standard deviation, and
  variance and interquartile range

*** Range
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: range
:END:
- The range is the difference between the max and min
- It is easy and quick to calculate and it is useful for comparing two
  data sets
- However it can be misleading due to extreme values

*** Standard deviation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: standard-deviation
:END:
- The standard deviation of a set of samplke values is a measure of
  variation of values about the mean

- If the standard deviation is small, the data is close to the mean

- If it is large the data is further away from the mean

- Standard deviation forumla

  - Square root of sum of data values - sample mean divided by sample
    size -1
  - The variance s^2 equals the standard deviation squared
  - The variance weighs outliers more heavily than data very near the
    mean due to the square, a higher variance helps you spot this
    easier.
  - However the standard deviation is often preferrred to the variance
    as a descriptive measure becasue it is in the same units as the data

**** Coefficient of variation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: coefficient-of-variation
:END:
- The coeffecient of variation is used to compare
  - Relative variation between two or more data sets ie the data set
    with the largest CV has the greatest spread.
  - Two or more sets of data that are measured in different units
- Coefficient of variation CV = Standard Deviation/mean x 100%

*** Interquartile RAange
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: interquartile-raange
:END:
- Percentile is defnied as the value below which a certain percentage of
  the data lies

- The 50th percentile is the value of which half of the lies

- The interquartile range of Q3-Q1 is a measure of variability that
  commonly is used for skewed data.

**** Finding iqr:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: finding-iqr
:END:
- To find the iqr we:

1. Sort the data values
2. Find the median
3. Place brackets around above or below the median
4. q1 is the median in the lower half and q3 is the median in the upper
   half
5. finally iqr is Q3-Q1

** Coeffecient of Skewness
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: coeffecient-of-skewness
:END:
- The coeffecient of skewness is calcualtes by: 3*(mean-median)/standard
  deviation(s)

- This measures the skewness of a distribution

- The direction of skewness is given by the sign of CS:

  - Negative means the distribution is negatively skewed
  - A positive value means the distribution is positively skewed
  - Zero means no skewness at all
