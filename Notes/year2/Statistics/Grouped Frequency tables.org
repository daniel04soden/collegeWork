* What are grouped frequency tables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-are-grouped-frequency-tables
:END:
- Intervals ie points scored 1-10,2-20 etc
- We can used both discrete or continuous data where the data set may
  have too many individual value sot list in a frequency table.
- A grouped frequency tables gives classes in which the data value will
  fail and the number of values in that class
- The classes cannot overall and there shouldn't be any gaps between the
  classes

| Parameters | Frequency | Relative frequency |
|------------+-----------+--------------------|
| =70, <80   | 2         | 2/30               |
| =80,<90    | 5         | 5/30               |
| =90,<100   | 6         | 6/30               |
| =100,<110  | 9         | 9/30               |
| =110,<120  | 4         | 4/30               |
| =120,<130  | 4         | 4/30               |

- To create a useful grouped table you need to consider how many classes
  appropriate and an appropriate width for each interval.
- The class width is given by
- Range/number of classes = largest value - smallest value/number of
  classes
- The number of classes and width are essentially arbitrary. The only
  rules in grouping data are that the classes are mutually exclusive and
  all inclusive.
