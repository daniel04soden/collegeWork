* What is Probability?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-is-probability
:END:
- A quantity indicating how likely a event to happen
- It is formalised by a branch of mathematics named probability theory
- There are however statistical inference techniques to estimate
  probabilities from empirical data.
- It branched into evaluating hypotheses given evidences and
  understanding the behaviour of random experiments

** Our study of probability
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: our-study-of-probability
:END:
1. Interpreting how experiments are defined
2. Grouping possible outcomes
3. Counting

* Types
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: types
:END:
1. Classical and axiomatic probability: follows formal definitions
2. Experimental: Based on observations of real world experiments
3. Subjective probability; Personal judgements

- *Main focus*: Classical and axiomatic

* Random experiments
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: random-experiments
:END:
- We will study classical probability by using mental experiments
- The in between type is computational experiments ie simulations

** Real vs Mental experiments

| Mental Experiments                                     | Real world                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|

| As soon as defined measure is defined                  | Measure needs to planned carefully                            |
| Unbiased                                               | Measuring Can influence and be influenced by the outcome      |
| Generalises the inner working of the process or system | Knowledge is built from memta anlaysis of several experiments |

- A procedure that can be repeated infinitely can only lead to a fixed
  and known set of outcomes

- Each trial of the random experiments produces one outcome ### Examples

- Poker hand rankings

- Rolling 2 dies

- Each trial of the random experiment produces one outcome and an event
  is a subset of all possible outcomes

- An event with a single outcome is known as elementary

- Generally an event is a group of outcomes

* Sample space
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sample-space
:END:
- For studying probability we will often need to interpret mental
  experiment problems and organise them into sets
- The union of all possible events is the sample space usually denoted
  with an omega symbol or an S

** Example
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: example
:END:
- Flipping two coins

- Outcome: Which face of the coin that lands up

- Sample space: *(HH,HT,TH,TT)*

  - Event:
    - A at least one head showing
    - Getting two tails
    - The same result on both coins
    - The coins show different results

- Since a sample space has all possible outcomes an event E has a
  complement E^c

- E^c is defined as all other elements not in E.

* Formal definition of probability
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: formal-definition-of-probability
:END:
- Probability space is a triple (Sample space, how outcomes are grouped
  into events, Probability functions) ## Probability function

- A probability function maps an event to a number between 0 and 1

- Probability of an empty event is always 0 the probability of the union
  of all events always 1

- The others depend on how events are defined

  - Flipping two coins:
    - One head 3/4
    - two tails 1/4
    - Same reesult 2/4
    - Different results 2/4 ## Complimentary probabilities

- Since all probabilities add up to 1, one can find the probability of a
  complementary event via

\[
P(E`) = 1 - P(E)
\]

- Same face die (30/36)
- Not blue 5 red 3 blue 2 green: 7/10

* Experimental Probability
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: experimental-probability
:END:
- Experimental probabilities are based on observed data
- You may not assume any prior knowledge of the process

In the case the probability of event E denoted P(e) is:

\[
\frac{times \ an \ event \ is \ denoted}  {total \ times \ experiment \ is \ performed}
\]
