# Computing Driven society

- Nowadays we have created a computing intensive society

- One one hand problems that require complex strategies must be
  addressed

- Algorithms that required complex computations to be executed

# Seven stages of Technological Evolution

1.  Awareness - Present data
2.  Learn and adapt - AI
3.  Communicate
4.  Process
5.  Store - NoSQL big data
6.  Connect - Collect data
7.  Sense

## Driven by big data

- **Problem**: Encode message
- **Technological**: Develop machines to encode and decode messages
- **Evolution** Developing new algorithm to speed up decoding.

# Data vs information

                  Data   Info
  --------------- ------ ------
  Meaning                
  example                
  Contains               
  Meaning                
  Interrelation          
  Dependency             

# Data types

- Data may be quantitative or qualitative in nature:

  - Quantitative Data is related to entities that deal with numbers or
    that can be measured
  - Qualitative: Deals with forms of info that is observable but not
    necessarily measurable\

- Languages to work with data: Nvivio, R, python

# Big data

- What is big data
  - Collecting large amount of data via computers,sensors and people
  - Doing something with it
- More data is being collected and source
- Open source code
- Commodity Hardware / Cloud

## Big data here to stay

- Ability to collect data will only increase and improve \### Promises
  of big data

- Collect large amounts of it

- Do something beneficial with it

- Big data

  - Big processes
    - Big models

- Big data refers to a huge volume of data that cannot be stored and
  processed with a traditional approach within a given time frame.

1.  Variety of data - diversity of data
2.  Velocity of data - How fast is the data coming in
3.  Volume of data - How much data being genreated
4.  Veracity of data - Data in doubt or uncertain of data available due
    to data inconsistency and incompleteness
5.  Value of data - Is beneficial?

## Variety /complexity

- Variety is about the abillity to classify the inoking data into
  various categories

- Excel, Rdbms

- XML,Json documents

- Images,Audio

# Big models

- Large industrial pipeline engineering products
- Requires many skilful engineers and is a big investment
  - Big data
  - Big computation power
  - Big money
  - Big energy consumption
- Originated from co training which was beleived to be only applicable
  to data with two sets of sufficient features
- Sufficient and necessary theorems proved: No need to have two sets of
  features : \"diverstiy of two models is vitial\"
  - This also shows that one cannot use it to improve a big model
    becuase the diversity of the models will dicrease as training
    proceeds
