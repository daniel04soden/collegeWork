# Inheritance continued

## Class Inheritance

- Child class of a parent class can be the parent of a another class
  causing a class hierachy

  - No matter what kind of class you make, you will always inherit the
    parents fields

# Polymorphism

## Static dynamic

- Static polymorphism - Overloading
  - Methods and constructors can have identical names but different
    signatures within the same class
- Dynamic Polymorphism - Overriding
  - Methods can have identical names and identical signatures in two
    classes related by inheritance
