* Module Introduction & Java basic syntax

#+begin_src java
// Simple hello world program
public class myMain {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello, world!")
    }
}

#+end_src


** Background: Java Programs execution
        - Most computers with Java know things such as for loops,booleans, data types, if statements etc
        - However it doesn't know things such as logarithms so we need to import certain libraries

#+begin_src java
// Importing files (sample not 100% accurate)

import Java.Math
    Math.log()

#+end_src

*** Type system

- Python is a dynamically typed language

 #+begin_src python

x=12
print(x)

 #+end_src
- Java is a statically typed language
 #+begin_src java
int x = 12;
boolean c = true;
ArrayList<Integer> e = new ArrayList<~>();
e.add(1);

System.out.println(x);

 #+end_src
*** Operators:
- Python: and, or, >,< ,>= etc
- Java: &&, ||, >,<,>- etc


*** Functions in Java
- In programming, modularity refers to the separation of the functionality of a program into independent interchangeable
  pieces, each of them fully repsonsible of a concrete task

  - Advantages of Modularity:
        - As size and complexity grows, tasks may become difficult but the decomposition of a
          problem into multiple small and independent pieces allows to better model the problem domain
