** Getting Started
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: getting-started
:END:
Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get
started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

** Folder Structure
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: folder-structure
:END:
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- =src=: the folder to maintain sources
- =lib=: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the =bin=
folder by default.

If you want to customize the folder structure, open
=.vscode/settings.json= and update the related settings there.

** Dependency Management
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dependency-management
:END:
The =JAVA PROJECTS= view allows you to manage your dependencies. More
details can be found
