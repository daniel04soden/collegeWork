* Javascript notes

** Loop options
- For
- For of
- For in
- while
- do while

** Array.forEach

- Calls a function once for each array element.
- callback function
- Function to multiply each value in an array of prices by 0.2% for a discount

 #+begin_example
        randomValues=[2,4,34,5]
        Array.forEach(multiplyNums)

        function multiplyNums(item,index,arr){
        arr[index] = item*10
        }
 #+end_example

** JavaScript sets

- A set is a collection of unique values
- Each element can only occur once in a sec
- Essential set methods:
  - new Set()
  - add,delete,has,forEach,values,property,size

   #+begin_src js

    let newSet = new Set([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]);

    newSet.add(20);
    newSet.add(2);

    newSet.forEach(function value){
    console.log(value)
    };

   #+end_src

** Javascript maps

- Holds key value pairs
  - Map methods:
    - new Map()
    - set
    - get,delete,has,entries,size


** Javascript functions

- Function invocation
- Function returns

 #+begin_src js

let x = myFunction(4,3);

function myFunction2(a,b){
return a*b
}

 #+end_src
** Local and global variables

- In functions we can have both local and variable scope
- If it is defined within the function you cannot access it outside of that function
- In local scope a variable cannot have the same name

** Parameters

A function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all
- the function changes a paramater but the change is not seen outside because a function always gets a copy of the value
** Callback function
- A function passed into another function as an argument
- Then invoked inside the outer functino to complete some kind of routine or action


* Server side web dev start

** Client vs Server
- Web apps are not stand alone, many of them have a cloud backend
- Hosting a web server is very easy these days by using any of the could based infrastructure servers like AWS and Azure
- HTTP,Rest (Representational State transfer) APIs, etc


** Hosting a web server

- Making a website/app available to users of the internet

*** Types of hosting
- Shared hosting: Website shares resources with several othr websites ( limited resources )
- Virtual Private server hosting: Dedicated resource on a server shared by fewer websites more control and performance
- Dedicated hosting: A dedicated physical server, expensive with high control and performance
- Cloud hosting: Uses a network of services to host websites offering scalability and reliability.

*** Advantages of cloud computing
- Cost
- Speed
- Flexibility

*** Networking alphabetic soup
- URL
- SOAP
- HTTP
- JSON
- XML
- REST
- GET
- DELETE
- POST

** Client
