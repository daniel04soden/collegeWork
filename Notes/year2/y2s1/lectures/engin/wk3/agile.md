# Agile and traditional Requirements engineering

## Big bang/Waterfall approach

- Figure out whats to be included in the entire project
- Past for very large government systems years back
- Many problems with this approach
- Everything everywhere all at once!
- Linear approach to software dev, in this method the sequence of events
  is as follows:
  - Requirements analysis -\> Design -\> Development -\> Testing -\>
    Maintenance/UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
- In waterfall we have srs (Software requirements specifications.)

### Negative points

- One area which almost always falls short is the effectivness of
  requirements.
- Customers sometimes intimidated by details and specific details,
  provided early in the project, are required with this approach.
- Most end users have some difficulty putting these elements together
  with written requirements to arrive at a good picture of what they
  will be getting
- Possibility of customer being dissatisfied after the delivered
  software product.
- A customer may not see what will be delivered until its nearly
  finished. By that time changes will be very costly to implement

## Agile approach

- Sprint - a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to
  complete a set amount of work.
- Writing test cases - before writing the code ie 3/0 before developing
  a division app
