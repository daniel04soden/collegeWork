# The Requirements Problem

## How we can approach solving this probleM:

- The goal of software dev is to develop quality softwware on time and
  on budget that meets customer\'s real needs

- This depends on effective requirements management.

- Requirements errors are the most common type of sysdev eror and the
  costliest to fix

- A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or
  achieve an objective

## What is a requirement?

- Requirements are descriptions of the services that a software system
  must provide and the constraints under which it must operate.
  - Yes but... syndrome
- Requirements can range from high level abstract statements of services
  or system constraints to detailed mathematical functional
  specifications.

### Good requirements has the following attributes:

- Coordinated
- Clear
- Necessary
- Consistent
- Verifiable
- Feasible
- Traceable
- Complete

### Factors to meet for a successful project:

1.  Delivery time
2.  Cost to budget
3.  Working as designed
4.  People use it
5.  The people who funded the project are happy with it.
6.  Meets the goals that drove the project.

### Shifting Project Objevtices

- Changing project objective are to blame for 36% of failed projets
- Over or under estimate timing
- Dependency delays, when other teams you\'re dependent on fail to
  deliver on time (23%)
- Not enough resources - Keeping within the scope of this specific
  project ðŸ’€

## Mediocre Requirements:

- Insufficient people consulted.
- Conflicting requirements form different sources.
- Adjusting poor requirements is not Scope creep.
