# Source Map

This is a library to generate and consume the source map format
[described
here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit).

This library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format,
and works in the following environments:

- Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or
  with an AMD loader such as RequireJS)

- Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)

- With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher

## Node

``` example
$ npm install source-map
```

## Building from Source (for everywhere else)

Install Node and then run

``` example
$ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git
$ cd source-map
$ npm link .
```

Next, run

``` example
$ node Makefile.dryice.js
```

This should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following
files:

- `dist/source-map.js`{.verbatim} - The unminified browser version.

- `dist/source-map.min.js`{.verbatim} - The minified browser version.

- `dist/SourceMap.jsm`{.verbatim} - The JavaScript Module for inclusion
  in Firefox source.

## Examples

### Consuming a source map

``` example
var rawSourceMap = {
  version: 3,
  file: 'min.js',
  names: ['bar', 'baz', 'n'],
  sources: ['one.js', 'two.js'],
  sourceRoot: 'http://example.com/www/js/',
  mappings: 'CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA'
};

var smc = new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);

console.log(smc.sources);
// [ 'http://example.com/www/js/one.js',
//   'http://example.com/www/js/two.js' ]

console.log(smc.originalPositionFor({
  line: 2,
  column: 28
}));
// { source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',
//   line: 2,
//   column: 10,
//   name: 'n' }

console.log(smc.generatedPositionFor({
  source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',
  line: 2,
  column: 10
}));
// { line: 2, column: 28 }

smc.eachMapping(function (m) {
  // ...
});
```

### Generating a source map

In depth guide: [**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source
Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)

1.  With SourceNode (high level API)

    ``` example
    function compile(ast) {
      switch (ast.type) {
      case 'BinaryExpression':
        return new SourceNode(
          ast.location.line,
          ast.location.column,
          ast.location.source,
          [compile(ast.left), " + ", compile(ast.right)]
        );
      case 'Literal':
        return new SourceNode(
          ast.location.line,
          ast.location.column,
          ast.location.source,
          String(ast.value)
        );
      // ...
      default:
        throw new Error("Bad AST");
      }
    }

    var ast = parse("40 + 2", "add.js");
    console.log(compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({
      file: 'add.js'
    }));
    // { code: '40 + 2',
    //   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] }
    ```

2.  With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)

    ``` example
    var map = new SourceMapGenerator({
      file: "source-mapped.js"
    });

    map.addMapping({
      generated: {
        line: 10,
        column: 35
      },
      source: "foo.js",
      original: {
        line: 33,
        column: 2
      },
      name: "christopher"
    });

    console.log(map.toString());
    // '{"version":3,"file":"source-mapped.js","sources":["foo.js"],"names":["christopher"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA"}'
    ```

## API

Get a reference to the module:

``` example
// NodeJS
var sourceMap = require('source-map');

// Browser builds
var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;

// Inside Firefox
let sourceMap = {};
Components.utils.import('resource:///modules/devtools/SourceMap.jsm', sourceMap);
```

### SourceMapConsumer

A SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can
query for information about the original file positions by giving it a
file position in the generated source.

1.  new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)

    The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which
    can be `JSON.parse`{.verbatim}\'d, or an object). According to the
    spec, source maps have the following attributes:

    - `version`{.verbatim}: Which version of the source map spec this
      map is following.

    - `sources`{.verbatim}: An array of URLs to the original source
      files.

    - `names`{.verbatim}: An array of identifiers which can be
      referrenced by individual mappings.

    - `sourceRoot`{.verbatim}: Optional. The URL root from which all
      sources are relative.

    - `sourcesContent`{.verbatim}: Optional. An array of contents of the
      original source files.

    - `mappings`{.verbatim}: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the
      actual mappings.

    - `file`{.verbatim}: Optional. The generated filename this source
      map is associated with.

2.  SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()

    Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column
    is inclusive.

3.  SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)

    Returns the original source, line, and column information for the
    generated source\'s line and column positions provided. The only
    argument is an object with the following properties:

    - `line`{.verbatim}: The line number in the generated source.

    - `column`{.verbatim}: The column number in the generated source.

    and an object is returned with the following properties:

    - `source`{.verbatim}: The original source file, or null if this
      information is not available.

    - `line`{.verbatim}: The line number in the original source, or null
      if this information is not available.

    - `column`{.verbatim}: The column number in the original source, or
      null or null if this information is not available.

    - `name`{.verbatim}: The original identifier, or null if this
      information is not available.

4.  SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)

    Returns the generated line and column information for the original
    source, line, and column positions provided. The only argument is an
    object with the following properties:

    - `source`{.verbatim}: The filename of the original source.

    - `line`{.verbatim}: The line number in the original source.

    - `column`{.verbatim}: The column number in the original source.

    and an object is returned with the following properties:

    - `line`{.verbatim}: The line number in the generated source, or
      null.

    - `column`{.verbatim}: The column number in the generated source, or
      null.

5.  SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)

    Returns all generated line and column information for the original
    source and line provided. The only argument is an object with the
    following properties:

    - `source`{.verbatim}: The filename of the original source.

    - `line`{.verbatim}: The line number in the original source.

    and an array of objects is returned, each with the following
    properties:

    - `line`{.verbatim}: The line number in the generated source, or
      null.

    - `column`{.verbatim}: The column number in the generated source, or
      null.

6.  SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source)

    Returns the original source content for the source provided. The
    only argument is the URL of the original source file.

7.  SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)

    Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and
    a generated line/column in this source map.

    - `callback`{.verbatim}: The function that is called with each
      mapping. Mappings have the form
      `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,   name }`{.verbatim}

    - `context`{.verbatim}: Optional. If specified, this object will be
      the value of `this`{.verbatim} every time that
      `callback`{.verbatim} is called.

    - `order`{.verbatim}: Either
      `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`{.verbatim} or
      `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`{.verbatim}. Specifies whether
      you want to iterate over the mappings sorted by the generated
      file\'s line/column order or the original\'s source/line/column
      order, respectively. Defaults to
      `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`{.verbatim}.

### SourceMapGenerator

An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is
being built incrementally.

1.  new SourceMapGenerator(\[startOfSourceMap\])

    You may pass an object with the following properties:

    - `file`{.verbatim}: The filename of the generated source that this
      source map is associated with.

    - `sourceRoot`{.verbatim}: A root for all relative URLs in this
      source map.

    - `skipValidation`{.verbatim}: Optional. When `true`{.verbatim},
      disables validation of mappings as they are added. This can
      improve performance but should be used with discretion, as a last
      resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when running
      tests, if possible.

2.  SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)

    Creates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer

    - `sourceMapConsumer`{.verbatim} The SourceMap.

3.  SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)

    Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the
    generated source\'s line and column for this source map being
    created. The mapping object should have the following properties:

    - `generated`{.verbatim}: An object with the generated line and
      column positions.

    - `original`{.verbatim}: An object with the original line and column
      positions.

    - `source`{.verbatim}: The original source file (relative to the
      sourceRoot).

    - `name`{.verbatim}: An optional original token name for this
      mapping.

4.  SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile,
    sourceContent)

    Set the source content for an original source file.

    - `sourceFile`{.verbatim} the URL of the original source file.

    - `sourceContent`{.verbatim} the content of the source file.

5.  SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer\[,
    sourceFile\[, sourceMapPath\]\])

    Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap. Each mapping
    to the supplied source file is rewritten using the supplied
    SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings is the
    minimium of this map and the supplied map.

    - `sourceMapConsumer`{.verbatim}: The SourceMap to be applied.

    - `sourceFile`{.verbatim}: Optional. The filename of the source
      file. If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it
      exists. Otherwise an error will be thrown.

    - `sourceMapPath`{.verbatim}: Optional. The dirname of the path to
      the SourceMap to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the
      SourceMap.

      This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren\'t in the
      same directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative
      source paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be
      rewritten relative to the SourceMap.

      If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same
      directory, thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying
      `'.'`{.verbatim} has the same effect.)

6.  SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()

    Renders the source map being generated to a string.

### SourceNode

SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or
concatenating snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while
maintaining the line and column information associated between those
snippets and the original source code. This is useful as the final
intermediate representation a compiler might use before outputting the
generated JS and source map.

1.  new SourceNode(\[line, column, source\[, chunk\[, name\]\]\])

    - `line`{.verbatim}: The original line number associated with this
      source node, or null if it isn\'t associated with an original
      line.

    - `column`{.verbatim}: The original column number associated with
      this source node, or null if it isn\'t associated with an original
      column.

    - `source`{.verbatim}: The original source\'s filename; null if no
      filename is provided.

    - `chunk`{.verbatim}: Optional. Is immediately passed to
      `SourceNode.prototype.add`{.verbatim}, see below.

    - `name`{.verbatim}: Optional. The original identifier.

2.  SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer\[,
    relativePath\])

    Creates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.

    - `code`{.verbatim}: The generated code

    - `sourceMapConsumer`{.verbatim} The SourceMap for the generated
      code

    - `relativePath`{.verbatim} The optional path that relative sources
      in `sourceMapConsumer`{.verbatim} should be relative to.

3.  SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)

    Add a chunk of generated JS to this source node.

    - `chunk`{.verbatim}: A string snippet of generated JS code, another
      instance of `SourceNode`{.verbatim}, or an array where each member
      is one of those things.

4.  SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)

    Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.

    - `chunk`{.verbatim}: A string snippet of generated JS code, another
      instance of `SourceNode`{.verbatim}, or an array where each member
      is one of those things.

5.  SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)

    Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the
    `SourceMap`{.verbatim} in the `sourcesContent`{.verbatim} field.

    - `sourceFile`{.verbatim}: The filename of the source file

    - `sourceContent`{.verbatim}: The content of the source file

6.  SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)

    Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The
    walking function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed
    that snippet and the its original associated source\'s line/column
    location.

    - `fn`{.verbatim}: The traversal function.

7.  SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)

    Walk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called
    for each source file content and is passed the filename and source
    content.

    - `fn`{.verbatim}: The traversal function.

8.  SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)

    Like `Array.prototype.join`{.verbatim} except for SourceNodes.
    Inserts the separator between each of this source node\'s children.

    - `sep`{.verbatim}: The separator.

9.  SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)

    Call `String.prototype.replace`{.verbatim} on the very right-most
    source snippet. Useful for trimming whitespace from the end of a
    source node, etc.

    - `pattern`{.verbatim}: The pattern to replace.

    - `replacement`{.verbatim}: The thing to replace the pattern with.

10. SourceNode.prototype.toString()

    Return the string representation of this source node. Walks over the
    tree and concatenates all the various snippets together to one
    string.

11. SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap(\[startOfSourceMap\])

    Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus
    a SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the
    generated and original sources.

    The arguments are the same as those to
    `new SourceMapGenerator`{.verbatim}.

## Tests

[\[\[<https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master>](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)\]\]

Install NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run
`node test/run-tests.js`{.verbatim}.

To add new tests, create a new file named
`test/test-<your new test name>.js`{.verbatim} and export your test
functions with names that start with \"test\", for example

``` example
exports["test doing the foo bar"] = function (assert, util) {
  ...
};
```

The new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.

The `util`{.verbatim} argument is the test utility module located at
`test/source-map/util`{.verbatim}.

The `assert`{.verbatim} argument is a cut down version of node\'s assert
module. You have access to the following assertion functions:

- `doesNotThrow`{.verbatim}

- `equal`{.verbatim}

- `ok`{.verbatim}

- `strictEqual`{.verbatim}

- `throws`{.verbatim}

(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need
the tests to run inside Firefox\'s test suite as well and so the assert
module is shimmed in that environment. See
`build/assert-shim.js`{.verbatim}.)
