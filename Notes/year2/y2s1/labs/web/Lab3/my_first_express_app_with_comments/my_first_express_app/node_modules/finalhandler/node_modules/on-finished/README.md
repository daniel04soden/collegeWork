Execute a callback when a HTTP request closes, finishes, or errors.

## Install

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install`{.verbatim}
command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ npm install on-finished
```

## API

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
var onFinished = require('on-finished')
```

### onFinished(res, listener)

Attach a listener to listen for the response to finish. The listener
will be invoked only once when the response finished. If the response
finished to an error, the first argument will contain the error. If the
response has already finished, the listener will be invoked.

Listening to the end of a response would be used to close things
associated with the response, like open files.

Listener is invoked as `listener(err, res)`{.verbatim}.

<!-- eslint-disable handle-callback-err -->

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
onFinished(res, function (err, res) {
  // clean up open fds, etc.
  // err contains the error if request error'd
})
```

### onFinished(req, listener)

Attach a listener to listen for the request to finish. The listener will
be invoked only once when the request finished. If the request finished
to an error, the first argument will contain the error. If the request
has already finished, the listener will be invoked.

Listening to the end of a request would be used to know when to continue
after reading the data.

Listener is invoked as `listener(err, req)`{.verbatim}.

<!-- eslint-disable handle-callback-err -->

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
var data = ''

req.setEncoding('utf8')
req.on('data', function (str) {
  data += str
})

onFinished(req, function (err, req) {
  // data is read unless there is err
})
```

### onFinished.isFinished(res)

Determine if `res`{.verbatim} is already finished. This would be useful
to check and not even start certain operations if the response has
already finished.

### onFinished.isFinished(req)

Determine if `req`{.verbatim} is already finished. This would be useful
to check and not even start certain operations if the request has
already finished.

## Special Node.js requests

### HTTP CONNECT method

The meaning of the `CONNECT`{.verbatim} method from RFC 7231, section
4.3.6:

> The CONNECT method requests that the recipient establish a tunnel to
> the destination origin server identified by the request-target and, if
> successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind forwarding of
> packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed. Tunnels are
> commonly used to create an end-to-end virtual connection, through one
> or more proxies, which can then be secured using TLS (Transport Layer
> Security, \[RFC5246\]).

In Node.js, these request objects come from the `'connect'`{.verbatim}
event on the HTTP server.

When this module is used on a HTTP `CONNECT`{.verbatim} request, the
request is considered \"finished\" immediately, **due to limitations in
the Node.js interface**. This means if the `CONNECT`{.verbatim} request
contains a request entity, the request will be considered \"finished\"
even before it has been read.

There is no such thing as a response object to a `CONNECT`{.verbatim}
request in Node.js, so there is no support for one.

### HTTP Upgrade request

The meaning of the `Upgrade`{.verbatim} header from RFC 7230, section
6.1:

> The \"Upgrade\" header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism
> for transitioning from HTTP/1.1 to some other protocol on the same
> connection.

In Node.js, these request objects come from the `'upgrade'`{.verbatim}
event on the HTTP server.

When this module is used on a HTTP request with an `Upgrade`{.verbatim}
header, the request is considered \"finished\" immediately, **due to
limitations in the Node.js interface**. This means if the
`Upgrade`{.verbatim} request contains a request entity, the request will
be considered \"finished\" even before it has been read.

There is no such thing as a response object to a `Upgrade`{.verbatim}
request in Node.js, so there is no support for one.

## Example

The following code ensures that file descriptors are always closed once
the response finishes.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
var destroy = require('destroy')
var fs = require('fs')
var http = require('http')
var onFinished = require('on-finished')

http.createServer(function onRequest (req, res) {
  var stream = fs.createReadStream('package.json')
  stream.pipe(res)
  onFinished(res, function () {
    destroy(stream)
  })
})
```
