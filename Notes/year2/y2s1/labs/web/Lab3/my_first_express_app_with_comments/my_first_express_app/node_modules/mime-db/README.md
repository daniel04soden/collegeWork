This is a large database of mime types and information about them. It
consists of a single, public JSON file and does not include any logic,
allowing it to remain as un-opinionated as possible with an API. It
aggregates data from the following sources:

- <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml>
- <http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types>
- <http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types>

## Installation

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npm install mime-db
```

### Database Download

If you\'re crazy enough to use this in the browser, you can just grab
the JSON file using [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). It is
recommended to replace `master`{.verbatim} with [a release
tag](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db/tags) as the JSON format may
change in the future.

``` example
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jshttp/mime-db@master/db.json
```

## Usage

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
var db = require('mime-db')

// grab data on .js files
var data = db['application/javascript']
```

## Data Structure

The JSON file is a map lookup for lowercased mime types. Each mime type
has the following properties:

- `.source`{.verbatim} - where the mime type is defined. If not set,
  it\'s probably a custom media type.
  - `apache`{.verbatim} - [Apache common media
    types](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types)
  - `iana`{.verbatim} - [IANA-defined media
    types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
  - `nginx`{.verbatim} - [nginx media
    types](http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types)
- `.extensions[]`{.verbatim} - known extensions associated with this
  mime type.
- `.compressible`{.verbatim} - whether a file of this type can be
  gzipped.
- `.charset`{.verbatim} - the default charset associated with this type,
  if any.

If unknown, every property could be `undefined`{.verbatim}.

## Contributing

To edit the database, only make PRs against
`src/custom-types.json`{.verbatim} or
`src/custom-suffix.json`{.verbatim}.

The `src/custom-types.json`{.verbatim} file is a JSON object with the
MIME type as the keys and the values being an object with the following
keys:

- `compressible`{.verbatim} - leave out if you don\'t know, otherwise
  `true=/=false`{.verbatim} to indicate whether the data represented by
  the type is typically compressible.
- `extensions`{.verbatim} - include an array of file extensions that are
  associated with the type.
- `notes`{.verbatim} - human-readable notes about the type, typically
  what the type is.
- `sources`{.verbatim} - include an array of URLs of where the MIME type
  and the associated extensions are sourced from. This needs to be a
  [primary source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source); links
  to type aggregating sites and Wikipedia are *not acceptable*.

To update the build, run `npm run build`{.verbatim}.

### Adding Custom Media Types

The best way to get new media types included in this library is to
register them with the IANA. The community registration procedure is
outlined in [RFC 6838 section
5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838#section-5). Types registered with
the IANA are automatically pulled into this library.

If that is not possible / feasible, they can be added directly here as a
\"custom\" type. To do this, it is required to have a primary source
that definitively lists the media type. If an extension is going to be
listed as associateed with this media type, the source must definitively
link the media type and extension as well.
