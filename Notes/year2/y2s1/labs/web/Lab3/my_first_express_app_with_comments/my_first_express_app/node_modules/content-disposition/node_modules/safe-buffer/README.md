Safer Node.js Buffer API

\*Use the new Node.js Buffer APIs (`Buffer.from`{.verbatim},
`Buffer.alloc`{.verbatim}, `Buffer.allocUnsafe`{.verbatim},
`Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow`{.verbatim}) in all versions of Node.js.\*

**Uses the built-in implementation when available.**

## install

``` example
npm install safe-buffer
```

## usage

The goal of this package is to provide a safe replacement for the
node.js `Buffer`{.verbatim}.

It\'s a drop-in replacement for `Buffer`{.verbatim}. You can use it by
adding one `require`{.verbatim} line to the top of your node.js modules:

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
var Buffer = require('safe-buffer').Buffer

// Existing buffer code will continue to work without issues:

new Buffer('hey', 'utf8')
new Buffer([1, 2, 3], 'utf8')
new Buffer(obj)
new Buffer(16) // create an uninitialized buffer (potentially unsafe)

// But you can use these new explicit APIs to make clear what you want:

Buffer.from('hey', 'utf8') // convert from many types to a Buffer
Buffer.alloc(16) // create a zero-filled buffer (safe)
Buffer.allocUnsafe(16) // create an uninitialized buffer (potentially unsafe)
```

## api

### Class Method: Buffer.from(array)

<!-- YAML
added: v3.0.0
-->

- `array`{.verbatim} {Array}

Allocates a new `Buffer`{.verbatim} using an `array`{.verbatim} of
octets.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
const buf = Buffer.from([0x62,0x75,0x66,0x66,0x65,0x72]);
  // creates a new Buffer containing ASCII bytes
  // ['b','u','f','f','e','r']
```

A `TypeError`{.verbatim} will be thrown if `array`{.verbatim} is not an
`Array`{.verbatim}.

### Class Method: Buffer.from(arrayBuffer\[, byteOffset\[, length\]\])

<!-- YAML
added: v5.10.0
-->

- `arrayBuffer`{.verbatim} {ArrayBuffer} The `.buffer`{.verbatim}
  property of a `TypedArray`{.verbatim} or a
  `new ArrayBuffer()`{.verbatim}
- `byteOffset`{.verbatim} {Number} Default: `0`{.verbatim}
- `length`{.verbatim} {Number} Default:
  `arrayBuffer.length - byteOffset`{.verbatim}

When passed a reference to the `.buffer`{.verbatim} property of a
`TypedArray`{.verbatim} instance, the newly created `Buffer`{.verbatim}
will share the same allocated memory as the TypedArray.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
const arr = new Uint16Array(2);
arr[0] = 5000;
arr[1] = 4000;

const buf = Buffer.from(arr.buffer); // shares the memory with arr;

console.log(buf);
  // Prints: <Buffer 88 13 a0 0f>

// changing the TypedArray changes the Buffer also
arr[1] = 6000;

console.log(buf);
  // Prints: <Buffer 88 13 70 17>
```

The optional `byteOffset`{.verbatim} and `length`{.verbatim} arguments
specify a memory range within the `arrayBuffer`{.verbatim} that will be
shared by the `Buffer`{.verbatim}.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
const ab = new ArrayBuffer(10);
const buf = Buffer.from(ab, 0, 2);
console.log(buf.length);
  // Prints: 2
```

A `TypeError`{.verbatim} will be thrown if `arrayBuffer`{.verbatim} is
not an `ArrayBuffer`{.verbatim}.

### Class Method: Buffer.from(buffer)

<!-- YAML
added: v3.0.0
-->

- `buffer`{.verbatim} {Buffer}

Copies the passed `buffer`{.verbatim} data onto a new
`Buffer`{.verbatim} instance.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
const buf1 = Buffer.from('buffer');
const buf2 = Buffer.from(buf1);

buf1[0] = 0x61;
console.log(buf1.toString());
  // 'auffer'
console.log(buf2.toString());
  // 'buffer' (copy is not changed)
```

A `TypeError`{.verbatim} will be thrown if `buffer`{.verbatim} is not a
`Buffer`{.verbatim}.

### Class Method: Buffer.from(str\[, encoding\])

<!-- YAML
added: v5.10.0
-->

- `str`{.verbatim} {String} String to encode.
- `encoding`{.verbatim} {String} Encoding to use, Default:
  `'utf8'`{.verbatim}

Creates a new `Buffer`{.verbatim} containing the given JavaScript string
`str`{.verbatim}. If provided, the `encoding`{.verbatim} parameter
identifies the character encoding. If not provided,
`encoding`{.verbatim} defaults to `'utf8'`{.verbatim}.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
const buf1 = Buffer.from('this is a tést');
console.log(buf1.toString());
  // prints: this is a tést
console.log(buf1.toString('ascii'));
  // prints: this is a tC)st

const buf2 = Buffer.from('7468697320697320612074c3a97374', 'hex');
console.log(buf2.toString());
  // prints: this is a tést
```

A `TypeError`{.verbatim} will be thrown if `str`{.verbatim} is not a
string.

### Class Method: Buffer.alloc(size\[, fill\[, encoding\]\])

<!-- YAML
added: v5.10.0
-->

- `size`{.verbatim} {Number}
- `fill`{.verbatim} {Value} Default: `undefined`{.verbatim}
- `encoding`{.verbatim} {String} Default: `utf8`{.verbatim}

Allocates a new `Buffer`{.verbatim} of `size`{.verbatim} bytes. If
`fill`{.verbatim} is `undefined`{.verbatim}, the `Buffer`{.verbatim}
will be *zero-filled*.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
const buf = Buffer.alloc(5);
console.log(buf);
  // <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00>
```

The `size`{.verbatim} must be less than or equal to the value of
`require('buffer').kMaxLength`{.verbatim} (on 64-bit architectures,
`kMaxLength`{.verbatim} is `(2^31)-1`{.verbatim}). Otherwise, a
\[=RangeError=\]\[\] is thrown. A zero-length Buffer will be created if
a `size`{.verbatim} less than or equal to 0 is specified.

If `fill`{.verbatim} is specified, the allocated `Buffer`{.verbatim}
will be initialized by calling `buf.fill(fill)`{.verbatim}. See
\[=buf.fill()=\]\[\] for more information.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
const buf = Buffer.alloc(5, 'a');
console.log(buf);
  // <Buffer 61 61 61 61 61>
```

If both `fill`{.verbatim} and `encoding`{.verbatim} are specified, the
allocated `Buffer`{.verbatim} will be initialized by calling
`buf.fill(fill, encoding)`{.verbatim}. For example:

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
const buf = Buffer.alloc(11, 'aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=', 'base64');
console.log(buf);
  // <Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64>
```

Calling `Buffer.alloc(size)`{.verbatim} can be significantly slower than
the alternative `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)`{.verbatim} but ensures that
the newly created `Buffer`{.verbatim} instance contents will *never
contain sensitive data*.

A `TypeError`{.verbatim} will be thrown if `size`{.verbatim} is not a
number.

### Class Method: Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)

<!-- YAML
added: v5.10.0
-->

- `size`{.verbatim} {Number}

Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* `Buffer`{.verbatim} of
`size`{.verbatim} bytes. The `size`{.verbatim} must be less than or
equal to the value of `require('buffer').kMaxLength`{.verbatim} (on
64-bit architectures, `kMaxLength`{.verbatim} is `(2^31)-1`{.verbatim}).
Otherwise, a \[=RangeError=\]\[\] is thrown. A zero-length Buffer will
be created if a `size`{.verbatim} less than or equal to 0 is specified.

The underlying memory for `Buffer`{.verbatim} instances created in this
way is *not initialized*. The contents of the newly created
`Buffer`{.verbatim} are unknown and *may contain sensitive data*. Use
\[=buf.fill(0)=\]\[\] to initialize such `Buffer`{.verbatim} instances
to zeroes.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(5);
console.log(buf);
  // <Buffer 78 e0 82 02 01>
  // (octets will be different, every time)
buf.fill(0);
console.log(buf);
  // <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00>
```

A `TypeError`{.verbatim} will be thrown if `size`{.verbatim} is not a
number.

Note that the `Buffer`{.verbatim} module pre-allocates an internal
`Buffer`{.verbatim} instance of size `Buffer.poolSize`{.verbatim} that
is used as a pool for the fast allocation of new `Buffer`{.verbatim}
instances created using `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)`{.verbatim} (and the
deprecated `new Buffer(size)`{.verbatim} constructor) only when
`size`{.verbatim} is less than or equal to
`Buffer.poolSize >> 1`{.verbatim} (floor of `Buffer.poolSize`{.verbatim}
divided by two). The default value of `Buffer.poolSize`{.verbatim} is
`8192`{.verbatim} but can be modified.

Use of this pre-allocated internal memory pool is a key difference
between calling `Buffer.alloc(size, fill)`{.verbatim}
vs. =Buffer.allocUnsafe(size).fill(fill)=. Specifically,
`Buffer.alloc(size, fill)`{.verbatim} will *never* use the internal
Buffer pool, while `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size).fill(fill)`{.verbatim}
*will* use the internal Buffer pool if `size`{.verbatim} is less than or
equal to half `Buffer.poolSize`{.verbatim}. The difference is subtle but
can be important when an application requires the additional performance
that `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)`{.verbatim} provides.

### Class Method: Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(size)

<!-- YAML
added: v5.10.0
-->

- `size`{.verbatim} {Number}

Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* and non-pooled `Buffer`{.verbatim} of
`size`{.verbatim} bytes. The `size`{.verbatim} must be less than or
equal to the value of `require('buffer').kMaxLength`{.verbatim} (on
64-bit architectures, `kMaxLength`{.verbatim} is `(2^31)-1`{.verbatim}).
Otherwise, a \[=RangeError=\]\[\] is thrown. A zero-length Buffer will
be created if a `size`{.verbatim} less than or equal to 0 is specified.

The underlying memory for `Buffer`{.verbatim} instances created in this
way is *not initialized*. The contents of the newly created
`Buffer`{.verbatim} are unknown and *may contain sensitive data*. Use
\[=buf.fill(0)=\]\[\] to initialize such `Buffer`{.verbatim} instances
to zeroes.

When using `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`{.verbatim} to allocate new
`Buffer`{.verbatim} instances, allocations under 4KB are, by default,
sliced from a single pre-allocated `Buffer`{.verbatim}. This allows
applications to avoid the garbage collection overhead of creating many
individually allocated Buffers. This approach improves both performance
and memory usage by eliminating the need to track and cleanup as many
`Persistent`{.verbatim} objects.

However, in the case where a developer may need to retain a small chunk
of memory from a pool for an indeterminate amount of time, it may be
appropriate to create an un-pooled Buffer instance using
`Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow()`{.verbatim} then copy out the relevant bits.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
// need to keep around a few small chunks of memory
const store = [];

socket.on('readable', () => {
  const data = socket.read();
  // allocate for retained data
  const sb = Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(10);
  // copy the data into the new allocation
  data.copy(sb, 0, 0, 10);
  store.push(sb);
});
```

Use of `Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow()`{.verbatim} should be used only as a
last resort *after* a developer has observed undue memory retention in
their applications.

A `TypeError`{.verbatim} will be thrown if `size`{.verbatim} is not a
number.

### All the Rest

The rest of the `Buffer`{.verbatim} API is exactly the same as in
node.js. [See the docs](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html).

## Related links

- [Node.js issue: Buffer(number) is
  unsafe](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4660)
- \[\[<https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/pull/4>\]\[Node.js Enhancement
  Proposal: Buffer.from/Buffer.alloc/Buffer.zalloc/Buffer()
  soft-deprecate\]\]

## Why is `Buffer`{.verbatim} unsafe?

Today, the node.js `Buffer`{.verbatim} constructor is overloaded to
handle many different argument types like `String`{.verbatim},
`Array`{.verbatim}, `Object`{.verbatim}, `TypedArrayView`{.verbatim}
(`Uint8Array`{.verbatim}, etc.), `ArrayBuffer`{.verbatim}, and also
`Number`{.verbatim}.

The API is optimized for convenience: you can throw any type at it, and
it will try to do what you want.

Because the Buffer constructor is so powerful, you often see code like
this:

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
// Convert UTF-8 strings to hex
function toHex (str) {
  return new Buffer(str).toString('hex')
}
```

***But what happens if `toHex`{.verbatim} is called with a
`Number`{.verbatim} argument?***

### Remote Memory Disclosure

If an attacker can make your program call the `Buffer`{.verbatim}
constructor with a `Number`{.verbatim} argument, then they can make it
allocate uninitialized memory from the node.js process. This could
potentially disclose TLS private keys, user data, or database passwords.

When the `Buffer`{.verbatim} constructor is passed a `Number`{.verbatim}
argument, it returns an **UNINITIALIZED** block of memory of the
specified `size`{.verbatim}. When you create a `Buffer`{.verbatim} like
this, you **MUST** overwrite the contents before returning it to the
user.

From the [node.js
docs](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_new_buffer_size):

> `new Buffer(size)`{.verbatim}
>
> - `size`{.verbatim} Number
>
> The underlying memory for `Buffer`{.verbatim} instances created in
> this way is not initialized. **The contents of a newly created
> `Buffer`{.verbatim} are unknown and could contain sensitive data.**
> Use `buf.fill(0)`{.verbatim} to initialize a Buffer to zeroes.

(Emphasis our own.)

Whenever the programmer intended to create an uninitialized
`Buffer`{.verbatim} you often see code like this:

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
var buf = new Buffer(16)

// Immediately overwrite the uninitialized buffer with data from another buffer
for (var i = 0; i < buf.length; i++) {
  buf[i] = otherBuf[i]
}
```

### Would this ever be a problem in real code?

Yes. It\'s surprisingly common to forget to check the type of your
variables in a dynamically-typed language like JavaScript.

Usually the consequences of assuming the wrong type is that your program
crashes with an uncaught exception. But the failure mode for forgetting
to check the type of arguments to the `Buffer`{.verbatim} constructor is
more catastrophic.

Here\'s an example of a vulnerable service that takes a JSON payload and
converts it to hex:

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
// Take a JSON payload {str: "some string"} and convert it to hex
var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  var data = ''
  req.setEncoding('utf8')
  req.on('data', function (chunk) {
    data += chunk
  })
  req.on('end', function () {
    var body = JSON.parse(data)
    res.end(new Buffer(body.str).toString('hex'))
  })
})

server.listen(8080)
```

In this example, an http client just has to send:

``` json
{
  "str": 1000
}
```

and it will get back 1,000 bytes of uninitialized memory from the
server.

This is a very serious bug. It\'s similar in severity to the [the
Heartbleed bug](http://heartbleed.com/) that allowed disclosure of
OpenSSL process memory by remote attackers.

### Which real-world packages were vulnerable?

1.  [`bittorrent-dht`{.verbatim}](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bittorrent-dht)

    [Mathias Buus](https://github.com/mafintosh) and I ([Feross
    Aboukhadijeh](http://feross.org/)) found this issue in one of our
    own packages,
    [`bittorrent-dht`{.verbatim}](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bittorrent-dht).
    The bug would allow anyone on the internet to send a series of
    messages to a user of `bittorrent-dht`{.verbatim} and get them to
    reveal 20 bytes at a time of uninitialized memory from the node.js
    process.

    Here\'s [the
    commit](https://github.com/feross/bittorrent-dht/commit/6c7da04025d5633699800a99ec3fbadf70ad35b8)
    that fixed it. We released a new fixed version, created a [Node
    Security Project disclosure](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/68),
    and deprecated all vulnerable versions on npm so users will get a
    warning to upgrade to a newer version.

2.  [`ws`{.verbatim}](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws)

    That got us wondering if there were other vulnerable packages. Sure
    enough, within a short period of time, we found the same issue in
    [`ws`{.verbatim}](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws), the most
    popular WebSocket implementation in node.js.

    If certain APIs were called with `Number`{.verbatim} parameters
    instead of `String`{.verbatim} or `Buffer`{.verbatim} as expected,
    then uninitialized server memory would be disclosed to the remote
    peer.

    These were the vulnerable methods:

    ``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
    socket.send(number)
    socket.ping(number)
    socket.pong(number)
    ```

    Here\'s a vulnerable socket server with some echo functionality:

    ``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
    server.on('connection', function (socket) {
      socket.on('message', function (message) {
        message = JSON.parse(message)
        if (message.type === 'echo') {
          socket.send(message.data) // send back the user's message
        }
      })
    })
    ```

    `socket.send(number)`{.verbatim} called on the server, will disclose
    server memory.

    Here\'s [the
    release](https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/1.0.1) where
    the issue was fixed, with a more detailed explanation. Props to
    [Arnout Kazemier](https://github.com/3rd-Eden) for the quick fix.
    Here\'s the [Node Security Project
    disclosure](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/67).

### What\'s the solution?

It\'s important that node.js offers a fast way to get memory otherwise
performance-critical applications would needlessly get a lot slower.

But we need a better way to *signal our intent* as programmers. **When
we want uninitialized memory, we should request it explicitly.**

Sensitive functionality should not be packed into a developer-friendly
API that loosely accepts many different types. This type of API
encourages the lazy practice of passing variables in without checking
the type very carefully.

1.  A new API: `Buffer.allocUnsafe(number)`{.verbatim}

    The functionality of creating buffers with uninitialized memory
    should be part of another API. We propose
    `Buffer.allocUnsafe(number)`{.verbatim}. This way, it\'s not part of
    an API that frequently gets user input of all sorts of different
    types passed into it.

    ``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
    var buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(16) // careful, uninitialized memory!

    // Immediately overwrite the uninitialized buffer with data from another buffer
    for (var i = 0; i < buf.length; i++) {
      buf[i] = otherBuf[i]
    }
    ```

### How do we fix node.js core?

We sent [a PR to node.js core](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4514)
(merged as `semver-major`{.verbatim}) which defends against one case:

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
var str = 16
new Buffer(str, 'utf8')
```

In this situation, it\'s implied that the programmer intended the first
argument to be a string, since they passed an encoding as a second
argument. Today, node.js will allocate uninitialized memory in the case
of `new Buffer(number, encoding)`{.verbatim}, which is probably not what
the programmer intended.

But this is only a partial solution, since if the programmer does
`new Buffer(variable)`{.verbatim} (without an `encoding`{.verbatim}
parameter) there\'s no way to know what they intended. If
`variable`{.verbatim} is sometimes a number, then uninitialized memory
will sometimes be returned.

### What\'s the real long-term fix?

We could deprecate and remove `new Buffer(number)`{.verbatim} and use
`Buffer.allocUnsafe(number)`{.verbatim} when we need uninitialized
memory. But that would break 1000s of packages.

~~We believe the best solution is to:~~

~~1. Change `new Buffer(number)`{.verbatim} to return safe, zeroed-out
memory~~

~~2. Create a new API for creating uninitialized Buffers. We propose:
`Buffer.allocUnsafe(number)`{.verbatim}~~

1.  Update

    We now support adding three new APIs:

    - `Buffer.from(value)`{.verbatim} - convert from any type to a
      buffer
    - `Buffer.alloc(size)`{.verbatim} - create a zero-filled buffer
    - `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)`{.verbatim} - create an uninitialized
      buffer with given size

    This solves the core problem that affected `ws`{.verbatim} and
    `bittorrent-dht`{.verbatim} which is `Buffer(variable)`{.verbatim}
    getting tricked into taking a number argument.

    This way, existing code continues working and the impact on the npm
    ecosystem will be minimal. Over time, npm maintainers can migrate
    performance-critical code to use
    `Buffer.allocUnsafe(number)`{.verbatim} instead of
    `new Buffer(number)`{.verbatim}.

### Conclusion

We think there\'s a serious design issue with the `Buffer`{.verbatim}
API as it exists today. It promotes insecure software by putting
high-risk functionality into a convenient API with friendly \"developer
ergonomics\".

This wasn\'t merely a theoretical exercise because we found the issue in
some of the most popular npm packages.

Fortunately, there\'s an easy fix that can be applied today. Use
`safe-buffer`{.verbatim} in place of `buffer`{.verbatim}.

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
var Buffer = require('safe-buffer').Buffer
```

Eventually, we hope that node.js core can switch to this new, safer
behavior. We believe the impact on the ecosystem would be minimal since
it\'s not a breaking change. Well-maintained, popular packages would be
updated to use `Buffer.alloc`{.verbatim} quickly, while older, insecure
packages would magically become safe from this attack vector.
