## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get
started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`{.verbatim}: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`{.verbatim}: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the
`bin`{.verbatim} folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open
> `.vscode/settings.json`{.verbatim} and update the related settings
> there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS`{.verbatim} view allows you to manage your
dependencies. More details can be found
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
