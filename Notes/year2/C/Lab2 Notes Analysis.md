# Exercise 1

- Working with input and encoding

- We use a key to offset the UTF8-encoding on the characters

- As best practices for c, declare i =0 seperately

- getchar() - Reads in character and directly stores as variable

- Why input = 0 as char... What is a 0 in character

- `getchar()`{.verbatim} has the side effect of removing the next
  character from the input buffer.

- `scanf`{.verbatim} is told to read one and only one character
  (`%c`{.verbatim}) this has the effect of ignoring everything else on
  that input line.

- In this exercise we are only taking in lowercase values, could be
  modified for use to read in and convert to uppercase.

- Conversion may be done with different addition to my -1.

- When processed successfully, add 1 to counter for loop (i).

# Exercise 2

# Exercise 3

# Exercise 4.

- Live coding assignment of converting to upper case
- c = c +- 32 ?
- Need to read up on it in C programming book.
