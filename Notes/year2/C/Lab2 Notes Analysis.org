- Working with input and encoding

- We use a key to offset the UTF8-encoding on the characters

- As best practices for c, declare i =0 seperately

- getchar() - Reads in character and directly stores as variable

- Why input = 0 as char... What is a 0 in character

- =getchar()= has the side effect of removing the next character from
  the input buffer.

- =scanf= is told to read one and only one character (=%c=) this has the
  effect of ignoring everything else on that input line.

- In this exercise we are only taking in lowercase values, could be
  modified for use to read in and convert to uppercase.

- Conversion may be done with different addition to my -1.

- When processed successfully, add 1 to counter for loop (i).

- Live coding assignment of converting to upper case
- c = c +- 32 ?
- Need to read up on it in C programming book.
