## Assessment Breakdown

1.  Lab work - 10%

- Live coding tasks in lab (Basic editor, no internet)
- 8 Labs to get

2.  Midterm Practical - 30%

- Evaluated in Lab on desktops
- Set of coding tasks

3.  End of Semester Project - 20%

- With programming competition

4.  SAQ - 40% End of semester

- In lab
- MCQ, code snippets, debugging

## Useful Resources

- Man pages
- C programming Language book
- The web.

# What is C?

- A systems programming language used for:
  - Operating systems
  - Firmware
  - Compilers, Drivers
  - Other programming languages
  - Network appliances, servers

## Why use C?

- Features, functionality, programming aids.
- Memory management,type checking.
- Speed of execution, ride fast at your own peril
- Thin layer above system execution
- Teaching aid to understand how computers

## Alternatives to C

- Rust from Mozilla
  - Modern
  - Fast as c mostly
  - Safer ( for the most part)
- Swift
  - Successor to Objective-C
  - Used in Macs
- Zig
  - Zero dependency drop in C compiler that supports cross compilation
    out of the box
  - No hidden control flow, memory allocation
  - No pre-processor, no macros

## Additional Notes

- Segmentation faults rather than stack trace errors in python3 or
  javac.
- No exceptions, type safety etc.
- Javac and sys programming language.
- C++,Rust and Zig as alternative system programming languages.
- Rust future of system programming.
- Don\'t think in code use English as a translation to code.
