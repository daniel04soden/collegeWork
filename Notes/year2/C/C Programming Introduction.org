* What is C?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-is-c
:END:
- A systems programming language used for:
  - Operating systems
  - Firmware
  - Compilers, Drivers
  - Other programming languages
  - Network appliances, servers

** Why use C?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: why-use-c
:END:
- Features, functionality, programming aids.
- Memory management,type checking.
- Speed of execution, ride fast at your own peril
- Thin layer above system execution
- Teaching aid to understand how computers

** Alternatives to C
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: alternatives-to-c
:END:
- Rust from Mozilla
  - Modern
  - Fast as c mostly
  - Safer ( for the most part)
- Swift
  - Successor to Objective-C
  - Used in Macs
- Zig
  - Zero dependency drop in C compiler that supports cross compilation
    out of the box
  - No hidden control flow, memory allocation
  - No pre-processor, no macros

** Additional Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: additional-notes
:END:
- Segmentation faults rather than stack trace errors in python3 or
  javac.
- No exceptions, type safety etc.
- Javac and sys programming language.
- C++,Rust and Zig as alternative system programming languages.
- Rust future of system programming.
- Don't think in code use English as a translation to code.
