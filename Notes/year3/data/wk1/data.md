# Intro

- When data is in its original form it is raw data
- We want to be able to visualize the characteristics of a dataset hence
  we construct graphical representations of the data
- We must look at the frequency of occurence of data values

## Data types

1.  Lists
2.  Dictionaries
3.  Sets
4.  Tuples

## Mutable and Immutable

- Mutable ds are: Lists, sets dictionaries and user defined classes
- Immutable ds are: Primitives ie strings ints and floats. Frozen sets,
  tuples and user defined classes
