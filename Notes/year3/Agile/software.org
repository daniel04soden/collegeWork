#+title: Software Architecture

* What is software?
- Set of instructions to acquire inputs and manipulate them ot produce the desired output in terms of functions and performace as determined by the user of the software
- Two types: Generic, customised
  - Generic: designed for broad customers whose requirements very common
  - Custom: Personalised customised products in their domain

** Attributes of good software.

1. Maintainability: Must evolve to meet changing requirements
2. Dependability: Software must be trustworthy
3. Efficiency: Not make wasteful use of resources
4. Usability


- Software is operational - it can be measured on budget usability correctness etc
- Software is  transitional - portable on various operating systems and environments
- Reusability, adaptability

*** Maintenance of software
- Modularity
- Scaling
- Flexibility
*** Software must change
- Adapted to meet the needs of new computing environments and technology
- Must be enhanced to implement new business requirements
- Must be re-architected to make it viable within a network environment
-Must be extended to make it interoperable with other more modern systems or databases

** Types of software
1. System software - Programs written to service other programs at system level ie compilers os
2. Real time - Programs that monitor analyze control real wrold events as they occur
3. Business - programs that access anaylze and process info
4. Engineership/Scientific - Software for different science and applications
5. Embedded software
6. AI software
7. Internet Software

** Software processes.

- Forms a basis of project management, budget and schedule, application of technical methods and product quality control
- Framework activities: work tasks,products,milestones,checkpoints
- Communication,Planning,Modelling,Construction, Deployment
