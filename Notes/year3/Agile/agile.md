# Agile Principles

- Formed in Feb 2001 when 17 thought leaders in software met to see if
  they had anything in common among the various light methodologies
- They wrote the agile manifesto and supporting principles.

## Principles of Agile Methods

1.  ****Customer Involvement**** - Customers should be closely involved
    throughout the development process. Their role is provided and
    prioritizes new system requirements and to evaluate the iterations
    of the system.
2.  ****Incremental delivery**** - The software is developed in
    increments with the customer specifying the requirements to be
    included in each increment
3.  ****People cannot process**** - The skills of the development team
    should be recognized and utilised to their best ability. Team
    members should be left to develop their own ways of working without
    prescriptive processes
4.  ****Embrace Change**** - Expect the system requirements to change
    and so design the system to accomodate these changes.
5.  ****Maintain Simplicity**** - Focus on simplicity in both the
    software being developed and in the development process. Wherever
    possible, actively work to eliminate complexity from the system.

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
  continous delivery of valuable software

- Welcome dynamic requirements, even late in development. Agile
  processes harness change of the customer\'s competitive advantage.
  Deliver working software frequently from a couple of weeks to a couple
  of months,with a preference to the shorter timescale.

- Business people and devs must work together throughout the project

## Iterative,Incremental and Evolutionary

- Minimize up-front planning and design by breaking product work into
  small increments.
  - Most methdos break tasks into small incremeents with minimal
    planning and do not directly involve long-term planning.
