1. Outline the four events that are a core part of a scrum process, with the reference to the specific roles of each team member
	
	- Sprint planning -> 
		- Product Owner, Developers, Scrum master 
	- Daily standup
		- Developers scrum master
	- Sprint review
		- Scrum master, product owner, developers, stakeholders
	- Sprint retrospective 
		- Scrum master, product owner, developers

2. Describe in detail the steps a scrum master will follow to facilitate a planning poker session as part of iteration planning.
	- Each member will be given numbered cards
	- Scrum master will get user stories from product owner
	- Product owner will ask any questions
	- Developers/Team members will pick numbered card (fib cards {1,2,3,5,8,13}) to allocate how many story points (time to complete) this user story would take
	- Will reveal cards at once
	- Scrum master will question highest and lowest
	- Repeat steps on each user story until all agree on story points
3. You are the scrum master for a team of 6 developers who follow an agile process and work in two-week sprints. In sprint 1 your team completed 18 story points, in sprint 2 they completed 22 story points, and in sprint 3, 4, and 5 they completed 37, 32, and 35 story points respectively
	
	- Average = 18+22+37+32+35/5=28.8
	- Given the average in the first two sprints is lower than the average velocity, we should keep up the same rough velocity by getting average of the last three and allocate that many story points therefore 37+32+35 = 34.6 ~ 35 story points
    
4. Brooks Law states that "Putting more people on a late project makes it later" What are the specific challenges that face a team in this situation? Under what circumstances would you recommend increasing the size of a development team that is struggling to meet a deadline?
    
5. Outline the four core values of the agile manifesto and give a brief description of each one
	- People and interactions over processes and tools - Prioritise core fundamental clear communication between developers, stakeholders and manager over worrying about the nitty gritty details of the tools being used such as the editor or the javascript runtime. Instead ensure that we are hitting the exact requirements the stakeholders are expecting and the scrum master is aware of peoples progress moreso than whether their workflow is optimal
	- Working software over comprehensive documentation - Although in an ideal world we would and should have both, that isn't always feasible due to things like deadlines, complexity etc. We should focus moreso on having a continuous delivery of stable efficient code rather than ensuring the imaginary new team member fully understands our 3 line function.
	- Customer communication over contractual negotiation - As developers we should be moreso concerned with the satisfaction of the end user rather than the satisfaction of our CEOs and backpockets. Delivering working ,easy to use and stable software is significantly more satisfying than earning a ludicrous amount of money while having a furious userbase
	- Responding to change over following a plan. - Although 
6. Explain how the following agile process can reduce the chance of a software project failure: a. Product owner b. Sprint demo c. Team ownership d. Daily scrum
	- Product owner - having a product owner to bounce ideas off of and consistently ask questions to makes sure a sprint is most succesful given the overall goal/initiative is fulfiilling the product goal and ensuring features/stories within sprints align with that goal means a highly successful outcome
	- Sprint demo - Having a functioning demo at the conclusion of each sprint means that stakeholders,project managers and scrum masters are able to ensure that quality progress is being made by the conclusion of each sprint
	- Daily scrum allows for developers to assist one another once theyre aware of what their peers have finished working on, are currently working on and whats preventing them from continuing working.
	- Team ownership - Ensuring any code integrated into the codebase is taken ownership from all developers on the team and all developers understand the code means that if in the middle of a sprint, a team member leaves, that work can be upkept wel by the remaining team members
	
7. Describe how the MoSCOW method can be used to prioritize tasks within a project
- Must should could wont
- Must is a requirement for the project/sprint meaning that it is non-negotiable and must be finished before conclusion
- Should is a high priority task that can be kept as a forefront of the work
- Could is something that doesn't NEED to be completed and can be pushed into later sprints but is currently possible to complete
- Won't is something a stakeholder or product owner has suggested as they will want/need it eventually however for the time being with the current amount of story points and velocity is infeasible to be completed.
    
2. A release was planned to include 180 points of work. The team expected an average velocity of 30.
