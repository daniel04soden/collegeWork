# Overview

- When a computer needs to communicate with another computer it needs to known the other computer's address
- Since it is not easy to  remember a full ip address we map it do domain names like cs.cit.ie or localhost.
- These are interpreted by domain name servers on the internet translation addresses.
- Two higher level protocols used in conjunction with the IP are the transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol.
- TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data, it guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order that they were sent
- UDP is  a standard low-overhead connectionless host-to-host protocol that is used over the IP
- UDP allows an app on one computer to send a datagram to an app on another computer
- We say that tcp is connection oriented whereas udp is connection less
