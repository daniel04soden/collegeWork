#+title: Priority Queues


* Priority queues

- A priority queue is an ADT to storea  aset S of elements supporting the following elements:
  - S=CREATE(A)
    - Creates a new priority queue containing all elements of the array A.

  - Insert(S,x)
    - Adding a enw element in the set ie S= S U {x}

  - x = EXTRACT-MINIMUM(S)
    - Returns element from S with the smallest key ie x E s so that all other elements are larger and remove it from the set ie S-={x}.

  - Decrease-Key(x,y):
    - For an element with key[x]>v change the value of the key to the new value key[x] = v, potentially moving it up the queue to be extracted earlier by the above operation

** Priority queues in operating systems

- Process scheduling is used in opearting systems, these are implemented often with priority based queues


** Priority queues in applicaitons

- Calendar reminders (MLF)
- TODO list
- Issue tracking in agile development tools, Jira


* Binary heaps

- Layered Logical structure
  - Lets consider a linear data structure with random access such as an array.
  - Then the addresses to access the data can be logically structured into layers so that each
    alwyas has twice the size of the previous layer.
    - 2^n-1 elements in the array
  - The height of a datapoint in this structure is the distance to the lowest layer
  - The relationship between the height h f the topmost first element and teh numer of elements n is n+1= 2^h+1 or
    h = log2(n+1) - 1

* Complete binary trees

- This layered logical structure can be visualised as a compelete binary tree.
