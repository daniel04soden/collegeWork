#+title: Lecture (Mainly module descrip)

* Server side web dev learning outcomes

1. Design an develop web apps with nodejs
2. Integrate and validate data from different databases into real web apps with mongodb

** What is expected of us?
- Very broad module, applied way to get the fundamentals working.
- Invest time outside class and labs to achieve goals.
- Just projects, no end of semester exam‚ò∫Ô∏è.
- Try to learn more outside of lecture material (maybe react??).

*** Assesment Schedule:
- 1 project different phases
- Module descriptor weeks not accurate
- 1 week on Javascript (cringeüòû)
- Week 5 Phase 1 25%
- MCQ week 9 30%
- Week 11 phase 2 35%
- Week 12 Presentation 10% Questions, presentation, knowledge (mainly to stop cheating)

*** Policies
- Late submissions
- Plagiarism
- Explain project code


* Real Notes

- Sever Side web dev is the creation and management of the back-end
  processes that handle HTTP requests and generate responses in a web app
- The code we will generate will be run on a web server that processes data,
  interacts with databases, manages user sessions and dynamically generates web pages
  before sending them to client's browser
- What we need:
        - Nodejs
        - Javascript
        - EJS- Embedded javascript template engine
        - Mongodb database to store data


** Key elements
**** Four layers of web apps:
- Client
- Server
- Business
- Data
- Web servers (Htttp)
- Static sites  - One that returns the same hard coded content form the server whenever a resource is requested
- Dynamic sites - One that where some of the response content is dynamically generated,
  only when needed using server side programming


** Server side web dev:

- Sample languages: PHP, nodejs, Python
- AKA the back end
