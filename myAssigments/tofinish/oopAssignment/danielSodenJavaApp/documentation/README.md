## Description of store/Main Functionality

- This computer shop functions like any other shop allowing users to view items, purchase items and return items.
- Before making any kind of purchases the user must register an account.
- In this project we assume each user has a Â£100 but can add more as time goes on (ATM Maybe?)
- Items: Laptops, Desktops, Spare parts
- Classes Hierarchy/Abstraction - Laptop -> Lenovo/Hp laptop -> Particular Generation/Models ??
-                     - Desktop -> Gaming/Workstation Desktop?
-                     - Parts -> Memory, Storage 
- Reading/Writing from files
- Main ideas
    - SQLite
    - Txt
    - CSV

- Data structures:
    - Arrays
    - Generics maybe
    - Custom datatypes?

- Interfaces:
    - Would work well for the object parts 
    - Just a class with undefined methods/fields??

- Exception Handling:
    - Exceptions for database types

- Final fields, methods and classes:
    - Final fields at the end of abstracted classes
