# Introduction and Steam & Leaf Plots

## Data Description

- If we registered data from a team playing a championship there re many different way to describe such data.

- Graphical methods is the representation of data in a graphical format
- The type of graphical method we use depends on the data type 

### Categorical data

- It does not map top numeric scale and must divided into categories
- the number of units falling into each category can be counted
- A bar or pie chart can be used to represent categorical data.
- For example, consider a sample of 1,056 students and the type of material they download from the internet 

#### Bar chat

- A bar chart can be used to present this data where each category is represented by a bar and the height represents the frequency for each category

#### Pie chart

- A pie chart represents each category as a proportion or percentage of the total frequency 
- A pie chart is visual representation of relative frequency 
- Sector angle = Relative frequency ( as a decimal ) x 360

### Numerical Data

-  Have numerical values
1. Stem and leaf plot
2. Histogram
3. Box-plot

#### Stem and Leaf Plot 

- This is used to visualise numerical data
- It is a useful way to represent smaller sets of data because:
1. All original values are shown
2. Illustrates the data distribution and where the data is concentrated


- It contains two column separated by a vertical line
- The left column has the stem and the right has the leaves
- When constructing it, we must:
1. Include a key to show how the stem and leaf combine 
2. List the stems and leaves in ascending order

# Skewed data 

- Left right or now normalised skew distribution essentially.
- Like leaving cert stuff.
