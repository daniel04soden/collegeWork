## Question 1
- [x] Question 1 ✅ 2025-04-23
- [ ] Polish off Question 1
- From a previous study we know that the birth weights of babies are normally distributed with a mean of  3,000g and a standard deviation of 500g. We believe that babies in this study have a mean birth weight greater than 3,000g. Perform an appropriate statistical test to test this hypothesis.  

## Question 2
-  Based on this sample, find an estimate for birth weight for the population with a 95% level of confidence.

## Question 3

-  Perform a suitable test to determine if smoking is associated with lower birth weight. In your analysis, examine birth weight across smoking status with appropriate descriptive statistics and graphics. Assess each sample for normality. Assess equality of variance. State the confidence interval (CI) for the difference in means and interpret these values. Assess if the result of the test is statistically significant.

## Question 4

- Perform a suitable test to determine if hypertension is associated with lower birth weight. In your analysis, examine birth weight across hypertension with appropriate descriptive statistics and graphics. Assess each sample for normality. Assess equality of variance. State the CI for the difference in means and interpret these values. Assess if the result of the test is statistically significant.

- [ ] Question 4

- For question 3 and 4:


- Descriptive Statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max)
- Graphics (box plots, histograms, density plots)
- Normality Tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
- Equality of Variance Tests (Levene's, Brown-Forsythe)
- Confidence Interval for the Difference in Means (from the chosen test)
- P-value (to assess statistical significance)
- P-value therefore hypothesis test maybe -
