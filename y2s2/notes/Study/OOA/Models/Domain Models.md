# Domains
- The subject area to which the user applies a program is the **domain** of the software
- Hardest part of software is understanding this domain **(critical complexity)** 
- **Problem domain** - the area of expertise that needs to be examined to solve a problem
-  If measuring KPI on sales, wouldn't measure ability to pick up rubbish, task of the day for workers but not what you're tasked with measuring.


# Domain Model

- **Domain Models** illustrate the conceptual classes in the problem domain
- Concepts discovered tend to lead to design classes
- Not real world conceptual classes, not of software components and not set of diagrams describing software classes or software objects with responsibilities
