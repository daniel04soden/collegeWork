# Domains
- The subject area to which the user applies a program is the **domain** of the software
- Hardest part of software is understanding this domain **(critical complexity)** 
- **Problem domain** - the area of expertise that needs to be examined to solve a problem
-  If measuring KPI on sales, wouldn't measure ability to pick up rubbish, task of the day for workers but not what you're tasked with measuring.


# Domain Model

- **Domain Models** illustrate the conceptual classes in the problem domain
- Concepts discovered tend to lead to design classes
- Not real world conceptual classes, not of software components and not set of diagrams describing software classes or software objects with responsibilities
- We decompose the domain of interest into individual classes or objects of the real world
- It is a visual representations of the conceptual classes or real world objects 
- We illustrate a Domain model using class diagrams through domain conceptual classes, associations between classes and attributes of conceptual classes.   
- The domain model is a visual dictionary of the noteworthy abstractions domain vocab and info around the general domain
- It ignores software artifacts such as a window or database
## Advantages of domain models

- Model becomes a stable basis for subsequent development of applications in the problem domain 
- Can be used to verify and validate our understanding of the problem domain among various stakeholders.
- It is especially helpful as a communication tool and a focusing point both amongst the different members of the business and technical team
