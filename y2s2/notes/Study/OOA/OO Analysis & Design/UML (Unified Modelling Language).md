### Is?
A language for 
- Visualising
- Specifying 
- Constructing
- Documenting
the artefacts of a software-intensive system
Provides a *common vocabulary* of object-orientated terms and diagramming techniques rich enough to model any systems development project from analysis through implementation
**Use Case Diagrams** - Shows functionality of a system
**Class Diagrams** - Describes structure of an object-orientated system by showing the classes in that system and the relationship between the classes
**Sequence Diagrams** - Describes an interaction among a set of objects in a scenario, arranged in chronological order
**Component Diagrams** - Classifying groups of classes into components supports the interchangeability and reuse of code
**Package Diagrams** - Used to simplify complex class diagrams, can group classes into packages
**State Machine Diagrams** - Used to describe state-dependent behaviour for an object
